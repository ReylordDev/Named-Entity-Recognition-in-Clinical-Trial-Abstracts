AIM [] : [] The ['ObjectiveDescription'] broadly ['ObjectiveDescription'] used ['ObjectiveDescription'] combination ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] metformin ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] sulphonylurea ['ObjectiveDescription'] ( ['ObjectiveDescription'] SU ['ObjectiveDescription'] ) ['ObjectiveDescription'] often ['ObjectiveDescription'] fails ['ObjectiveDescription'] to ['ObjectiveDescription'] bring ['ObjectiveDescription'] patients ['ObjectiveDescription'] to ['ObjectiveDescription'] glycaemic ['ObjectiveDescription'] goal ['ObjectiveDescription'] . ['ObjectiveDescription']
This ['ObjectiveDescription'] study ['ObjectiveDescription'] assessed ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] efficacy ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] safety ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] vildagliptin ['ObjectiveDescription'] as ['ObjectiveDescription'] add ['ObjectiveDescription'] - ['ObjectiveDescription'] on ['ObjectiveDescription'] therapy ['ObjectiveDescription'] to ['ObjectiveDescription'] metformin ['ObjectiveDescription'] plus ['ObjectiveDescription'] glimepiride ['ObjectiveDescription'] combination ['ObjectiveDescription'] in ['ObjectiveDescription'] patients ['ObjectiveDescription'] with ['ObjectiveDescription'] type ['ObjectiveDescription'] 2 ['ObjectiveDescription'] diabetes ['ObjectiveDescription'] mellitus ['ObjectiveDescription'] ( ['ObjectiveDescription'] T2DM ['ObjectiveDescription'] ) ['ObjectiveDescription'] who ['ObjectiveDescription'] had ['ObjectiveDescription'] inadequate ['ObjectiveDescription'] glycaemic ['ObjectiveDescription'] control ['ObjectiveDescription'] . ['ObjectiveDescription']
METHODS [] : [] A [] multicentre [] , [] double [] - [] blind [] , [] placebo [] - [] controlled [] study [] randomized [] patients [] to [] receive [] treatment [] with [] vildagliptin [] 50 ['DoseValue']  [] mg [] bid ['Frequency'] ( [] n [] = [] 158 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ) [] or [] placebo [] ( [] n [] = [] 160 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ) [] for [] 24 []  [] weeks [] . []
RESULTS [] : [] After [] 24 []  [] weeks [] , [] the [] adjusted [] mean [] change [] in [] haemoglobin [] A1c [] ( [] HbA1c [] ) [] was [] - [] 1 [] . [] 01 [] % [] with [] vildagliptin [] ( [] baseline [] 8 [] . [] 75 [] % [] ) [] and [] - [] 0 [] . [] 25 [] % [] with [] placebo [] ( [] baseline [] 8 [] . [] 80 [] % [] ) [] , [] with [] a [] between [] - [] treatment [] difference [] of [] - ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] 0 ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] . ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] 76 ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] % [] ( [] p ['PvalueDiff'] < ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 001 ['PvalueDiff'] ) [] . []
Significantly [] more [] patients [] on [] vildagliptin [] achieved [] the [] HbA1c [] target [] < [] 7 [] % [] ( [] 28 ['PercentageAffected'] . ['PercentageAffected'] 3 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] vs [] . [] 5 ['PercentageAffected'] . ['PercentageAffected'] 6 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] ; [] p ['PvalueDiff'] < ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 001 ['PvalueDiff'] ) [] . []
The [] difference [] in [] fasting [] plasma [] glucose [] reduction [] between [] vildagliptin [] and [] placebo [] was [] - ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] 1 ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] . ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] 13 ['DiffGroupAbsValue']  [] mmol [] / [] l [] ( [] p ['PvalueDiff'] < ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 001 ['PvalueDiff'] ) [] . []
In [] subgroup [] of [] patients ['SubGroupDescription'] with ['SubGroupDescription'] baseline ['SubGroupDescription'] HbA1c ['SubGroupDescription'] ≤ ['SubGroupDescription'] 8 ['SubGroupDescription'] % ['SubGroupDescription'] , [] vildagliptin [] reduced [] HbA1c [] by [] 0 [] . [] 74 [] % [] from [] baseline [] 7 [] . [] 82 [] % [] ( [] between [] - [] treatment [] difference [] : [] - ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] 0 ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] . ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] 97 ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] % [] ; [] p ['PvalueDiff'] < ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 001 ['PvalueDiff'] ) [] with [] significantly [] more [] patients [] achieving [] the [] HbA1c [] target [] < [] 7 [] % [] ( [] 38 ['PercentageAffected'] . ['PercentageAffected'] 6 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] vs [] . [] 13 ['PercentageAffected'] . ['PercentageAffected'] 9 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] ; [] p ['PvalueDiff'] = ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 014 ['PvalueDiff'] ) [] . []
Vildagliptin [] was [] well [] tolerated [] with [] low [] incidence [] of [] hypoglycaemia [] , [] slightly [] higher [] than [] with [] placebo [] ( [] 5 ['PercentageAffected'] . ['PercentageAffected'] 1 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] vs [] . [] 1 ['PercentageAffected'] . ['PercentageAffected'] 9 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] ) [] and [] no [] clinically [] relevant [] weight [] gain [] . []
CONCLUSIONS [] : [] Vildagliptin ['ConclusionComment'] significantly ['ConclusionComment'] improved ['ConclusionComment'] glycaemic ['ConclusionComment'] control ['ConclusionComment'] in ['ConclusionComment'] patients ['ConclusionComment'] with ['ConclusionComment'] T2DM ['ConclusionComment'] inadequately ['ConclusionComment'] controlled ['ConclusionComment'] with ['ConclusionComment'] metformin ['ConclusionComment'] plus ['ConclusionComment'] glimepiride ['ConclusionComment'] combination ['ConclusionComment'] . ['ConclusionComment']
The ['ConclusionComment'] addition ['ConclusionComment'] of ['ConclusionComment'] vildagliptin ['ConclusionComment'] was ['ConclusionComment'] well ['ConclusionComment'] tolerated ['ConclusionComment'] with ['ConclusionComment'] low ['ConclusionComment'] risk ['ConclusionComment'] of ['ConclusionComment'] hypoglycaemia ['ConclusionComment'] and ['ConclusionComment'] weight ['ConclusionComment'] gain ['ConclusionComment'] . ['ConclusionComment']
This ['ConclusionComment'] makes ['ConclusionComment'] vildagliptin ['ConclusionComment'] an ['ConclusionComment'] attractive ['ConclusionComment'] treatment ['ConclusionComment'] option ['ConclusionComment'] for ['ConclusionComment'] patients ['ConclusionComment'] failing ['ConclusionComment'] on ['ConclusionComment'] metformin ['ConclusionComment'] plus ['ConclusionComment'] SU ['ConclusionComment'] particularly ['ConclusionComment'] in ['ConclusionComment'] patients ['ConclusionComment'] with ['ConclusionComment'] baseline ['ConclusionComment'] HbA1c ['ConclusionComment'] ≤ ['ConclusionComment'] 8 ['ConclusionComment'] % ['ConclusionComment'] .
