OBJECTIVE [] : [] The ['ObjectiveDescription'] efficacy ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] tolerability ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] dipeptidyl ['ObjectiveDescription'] peptidase ['ObjectiveDescription'] - ['ObjectiveDescription'] 4 ['ObjectiveDescription'] inhibitor ['ObjectiveDescription'] sitagliptin ['ObjectiveDescription'] added ['ObjectiveDescription'] to ['ObjectiveDescription'] ongoing ['ObjectiveDescription'] pioglitazone ['ObjectiveDescription'] therapy ['ObjectiveDescription'] were ['ObjectiveDescription'] assessed ['ObjectiveDescription'] in ['ObjectiveDescription'] patients ['ObjectiveDescription'] with ['ObjectiveDescription'] type ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] 2 ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] diabetes ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] and ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] inadequate ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] glycemic ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] control ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] ( ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] glycosylated ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] hemoglobin ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] [ ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] HbA ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] ( ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] 1c ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] ) ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] ] ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] > ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] or ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] = ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] 7 ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] % ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] and ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] < ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] or ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] = ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] 10 ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] % ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] ) ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] while ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] receiving ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] a ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] stable ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] dose ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] of ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] pioglitazone ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] . ['ObjectiveDescription']
METHODS [] : [] This [] was [] a [] 24 [] - [] week [] , [] multicenter [] , [] randomized [] , [] double [] - [] blind [] , [] placebo [] - [] controlled [] , [] parallel [] group [] study [] in [] patients [] aged [] > [] or [] = [] 18 ['MinAge'] years [] ( [] ClinicalTrials [] . []
gov [] NCT00086502 [] ) [] . []
At [] screening [] , [] all [] patients [] began [] a [] diet [] / [] exercise [] program [] that [] continued [] throughout [] the [] study [] period [] . []
Patients [] taking [] antihyperglycemic [] therapy [] other [] than [] pioglitazone [] underwent [] a [] washout [] of [] this [] therapy [] and [] entered [] an [] 8 [] - [] to [] 14 [] - [] week [] open [] - [] label [] pioglitazone [] dose [] - [] titration [] / [] stabilization [] period [] . []
Patients [] with [] an [] HbA [] ( [] 1c [] ) [] > [] or [] = [] 7 [] % [] and [] < [] or [] = [] 10 [] % [] at [] the [] end [] of [] this [] period [] entered [] a [] 2 [] - [] week [] , [] single [] - [] blind [] , [] placebo [] run [] - [] in [] period [] ( [] total [] duration [] of [] run [] - [] in [] period [] , [] up [] to [] 21 [] weeks [] ) [] .

Patients [] who [] had [] been [] receiving [] pioglitazone [] monotherapy [] ( [] 30 [] or [] 45 [] mg [] / [] d [] ) [] and [] had [] an [] HbA [] ( [] 1c [] ) [] > [] or [] = [] 7 [] % [] and [] < [] or [] = [] 10 [] % [] entered [] the [] 2 [] - [] week [] , [] single [] - [] blind [] , [] placebo [] run [] - [] in [] period [] directly [] . []
Thus [] , [] at [] the [] time [] of [] randomization [] , [] all [] patients [] were [] receiving [] ongoing [] pioglitazone [] ( [] 30 [] or [] 45 [] mg [] / [] d [] ) [] . []
Patients [] were [] randomized [] in [] a [] 1 ['AllocationRatio'] : ['AllocationRatio'] 1 ['AllocationRatio'] ratio [] to [] receive [] sitagliptin [] 100 ['DoseValue'] mg [] once ['Frequency'] daily ['Frequency'] or [] placebo [] for [] 24 [] weeks [] . []
The [] primary [] efficacy [] end [] point [] was [] the [] change [] from [] baseline [] in [] HbA [] ( [] 1c [] ) [] at [] week [] 24 [] . []
Secondary [] efficacy [] end [] points [] included [] the [] change [] from [] baseline [] in [] fasting [] plasma [] glucose [] ( [] FPG [] ) [] , [] insulin [] , [] and [] proinsulin [] ; [] the [] Homeostasis [] Model [] Assessment [] beta [] - [] cell [] function [] and [] insulin [] - [] resistance [] indexes [] ; [] the [] proinsulin [] / [] insulin [] ratio [] ; [] the [] Quantitative [] Insulin [] Sensitivity [] Check [] Index [] ; [] the [] percent [] changes [] from [] baseline [] in [] selected [] lipid [] parameters [] ; [] the [] proportion [] of [] patients [] meeting [] the [] American [] Diabetes [] Association [] HbA [] ( [] 1c [] ) [] , [] goal [] of [] < [] 7 [] .

The [] dipeptidyl [] peptidase [] - [] 4 [] inhibitors [] vildagliptin [] and [] sitagliptin [] are [] effective [] in [] treating [] patients [] with [] type [] 2 [] diabetes [] mellitus [] . []
Patients [] receiving [] standard [] doses [] of [] sitagliptin [] plus [] insulin [] may [] require [] increased [] doses [] of [] sitagliptin [] or [] switching [] to [] vildagliptin [] to [] improve [] blood [] glucose [] control [] . []
This ['ObjectiveDescription'] study ['ObjectiveDescription'] compared ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] effects ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] increasing ['ObjectiveDescription'] sitagliptin ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] switching ['ObjectiveDescription'] to ['ObjectiveDescription'] vildagliptin ['ObjectiveDescription'] in ['ObjectiveDescription'] type ['ObjectiveDescription'] 2 ['ObjectiveDescription'] diabetes ['ObjectiveDescription'] patients ['ObjectiveDescription'] receiving ['ObjectiveDescription'] standard ['ObjectiveDescription'] doses ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] sitagliptin ['ObjectiveDescription'] plus ['ObjectiveDescription'] insulin ['ObjectiveDescription'] . ['ObjectiveDescription']
This [] prospective [] , [] randomized [] , [] parallel [] - [] group [] comparison [] trial [] enrolled [] 33 ['NumberPatientsCT'] type ['Precondition'] 2 ['Precondition'] diabetes ['Precondition'] patients ['Precondition'] receiving ['Precondition'] 50 ['DoseValue', 'Precondition'] mg ['Precondition'] sitagliptin ['Precondition'] once ['Precondition'] daily ['Precondition'] plus ['Precondition'] insulin ['Precondition'] . []
Seventeen ['NumberPatientsArm'] patients [] were [] randomized [] to [] 50 ['DoseValue'] mg [] vildagliptin [] twice ['Frequency'] daily ['Frequency'] , [] and [] 16 ['NumberPatientsArm'] to [] 100 [] mg [] sitagliptin [] once ['Frequency'] daily ['Frequency'] , [] and [] evaluated [] by [] continuous [] glucose [] monitoring [] at [] baseline [] and [] after [] 8 [] weeks [] . []
The [] primary [] end [] - [] point [] was [] the [] change [] in [] mean [] amplitude [] of [] glycemic [] excursions [] ( [] MAGE [] ) [] . []
MAGE [] decreased [] from [] baseline [] in [] both [] the [] vildagliptin [] ( [] - [] 13 [] . [] 4 [] ± [] 35 ['SdDevChangeValue'] .

['SdDevChangeValue'] 3 ['SdDevChangeValue'] mg [] / [] dL [] ) [] groups [] , [] but [] neither [] within [] - [] nor [] between [] - [] group [] changes [] were [] statistically [] significant [] . []
Similarly [] , [] the [] areas [] under [] the [] curve [] for [] blood [] glucose [] levels [] ≥ [] 180 [] mg [] / [] dL [] and [] < [] 70 [] mg [] / [] dL [] tended [] to [] improve [] in [] both [] groups [] , [] but [] these [] differences [] were [] not [] statistically [] significant [] . []
In [] contrast [] , [] HbA1c [] was [] significantly [] reduced [] only [] in [] the [] vildagliptin [] group [] , [] from [] 7 [] . [] 1 [] ± [] 0 ['SdDevBL'] . ['SdDevBL'] 6 ['SdDevBL'] % [] at [] baseline [] to [] 6 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] . ['ResultMeasuredValue'] 8 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] ± [] 0 ['SdDevResValue'] .

The [] addition [] of [] sitagliptin [] reduced [] FPG [] by [] 20 ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] . ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] 1 ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] mg [] / [] dl [] ( [] p ['PvalueDiff'] < ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 001 ['PvalueDiff'] ) [] and [] increased [] homeostasis [] model [] assessment [] - [] beta [] , [] a [] marker [] of [] beta [] - [] cell [] function [] , [] by [] 12 [] % [] ( [] p ['PvalueDiff'] < ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 05 ['PvalueDiff'] ) [] relative [] to [] placebo [] . []
In [] patients [] who [] underwent [] a [] meal [] tolerance [] test [] ( [] n [] = [] 134 [] ) [] , [] sitagliptin [] decreased [] 2 [] - [] h [] post [] - [] prandial [] glucose [] ( [] PPG [] ) [] by [] 36 ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] .

STUDY [] OBJECTIVE [] : [] To ['ObjectiveDescription'] evaluate ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] effect ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] acarbose ['ObjectiveDescription'] on ['ObjectiveDescription'] glycemic ['ObjectiveDescription'] control ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] glycemic ['ObjectiveDescription'] variability ['ObjectiveDescription'] , ['ObjectiveDescription'] using ['ObjectiveDescription'] a ['ObjectiveDescription'] continuous ['ObjectiveDescription'] glucose ['ObjectiveDescription'] - ['ObjectiveDescription'] monitoring ['ObjectiveDescription'] system ['ObjectiveDescription'] , ['ObjectiveDescription'] in ['ObjectiveDescription'] patients ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] with ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] type ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] 2 ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] diabetes ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] mellitus ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] who ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] were ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] not ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] well ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] controlled ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] on ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] metformin ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] and ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] vildagliptin ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] therapy ['ObjectiveDescription', 'Precondition'] . ['ObjectiveDescription']
DESIGN [] : [] Multicenter [] , [] randomized [] , [] double [] - [] blind [] , [] placebo [] - [] controlled [] study [] . []
SETTING [] : [] Clinical [] research [] units [] at [] three [] hospitals [] in [] Italy [] . []
PATIENTS [] : [] Fifty ['NumberPatientsCT'] - ['NumberPatientsCT'] three ['NumberPatientsCT'] patients [] with [] type [] 2 [] diabetes [] who [] were [] taking [] stable [] dosages [] of [] metformin [] 850 [] mg [] 3 [] times [] / [] day [] and [] vildagliptin [] 50 [] mg [] twice [] / [] day [] for [] at [] least [] 3 [] months [] and [] who [] were [] not [] adequately [] controlled [] with [] these [] therapies [] . []
INTERVENTION [] : [] Patients [] were [] randomized [] to [] either [] placebo [] or [] acarbose [] 100 ['DoseValue'] mg [] 3 ['Frequency'] times ['Frequency'] / ['Frequency'] day ['Frequency'] to [] be [] added [] to [] their [] metformin [] - [] vildagliptin [] regimen [] . []
MEASUREMENTS [] AND [] MAIN [] RESULTS [] : [] Glycemic [] excursions [] were [] assessed [] by [] using [] a [] continuous [] glucose [] - [] monitoring [] system [] for [] 1 [] week [] . []
Glycemic [] control [] was [] estimated [] as [] the [] mean [] blood [] glucose [] ( [] MBG [] ) [] level [] , [] the [] area [] under [] the [] glucose [] concentration [] - [] time [] curve [] for [] a [] glucose [] level [] above [] 70 [] mg [] / [] dl [] ( [] AUC [] above [] 70 [] ) [] or [] 180 [] mg [] / [] dl [] ( [] AUC [] above [] 180 [] ) [] , [] and [] the [] percentage [] of [] time [] that [] the [] glucose [] level [] was [] above [] 70 [] mg [] / [] dl [] ( [] T [] above [] 70 [] ) [] or [] 180 [] mg [] / [] dl [] ( [] T [] above [] 180 [] ) [] . []
Intraday [] glycemic [] variability [] was [] assessed [] by [] the [] standard [] deviation [] of [] the [] blood [] glucose [] level [] , [] the [] mean [] amplitude [] of [] glycemic [] excursions [] ( [] MAGE [] ) [] , [] the [] M [] value [] , [] and [] continuous [] overlapping [] net [] glycemic [] action [] . []
Day [] - [] to [] - [] day [] glycemic [] variability [] was [] assessed [] as [] the [] mean [] of [] daily [] difference [] ( [] MODD [] ) [] . []
The [] MBG [] level [] was ['ObservedResult'] ~ ['DiffGroupAbsValue', 'ObservedResult'] 20 ['DiffGroupAbsValue', 'ObservedResult'] mg ['ObservedResult'] / ['ObservedResult'] dl ['ObservedResult'] lower ['ObservedResult'] in ['ObservedResult'] the ['ObservedResult'] acarbose ['ObservedResult'] group ['ObservedResult'] than ['ObservedResult'] in ['ObservedResult'] the ['ObservedResult'] placebo ['ObservedResult'] group ['ObservedResult'] ( ['ObservedResult'] p ['ObservedResult', 'PvalueDiff'] < ['ObservedResult', 'PvalueDiff'] 0 ['ObservedResult', 'PvalueDiff'] . ['ObservedResult', 'PvalueDiff'] 05 ['ObservedResult', 'PvalueDiff'] ) ['ObservedResult'] , ['ObservedResult'] particularly ['ObservedResult'] during ['ObservedResult'] the ['ObservedResult'] postprandial ['ObservedResult'] period ['ObservedResult'] . []
The [] AUC [] above [] 70 [] did ['ObservedResult'] not ['ObservedResult'] significantly ['ObservedResult'] differ ['ObservedResult'] between ['ObservedResult'] the ['ObservedResult'] two ['ObservedResult'] groups ['ObservedResult'] , [] whereas [] the [] AUC [] above [] 180 [] was ['ObservedResult'] ~ ['ObservedResult'] 40 ['ObservedResult'] % ['ObservedResult'] lower ['ObservedResult'] in ['ObservedResult'] the ['ObservedResult'] acarbose ['ObservedResult'] group ['ObservedResult'] than ['ObservedResult'] in ['ObservedResult'] the ['ObservedResult'] placebo ['ObservedResult'] group ['ObservedResult'] during ['ObservedResult'] the ['ObservedResult'] daytime ['ObservedResult'] ( [] p ['PvalueDiff'] < ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 01 ['PvalueDiff'] ) [] . []
The [] T [] above [] 180 [] was [] significantly [] higher [] in [] the [] placebo [] group [] than [] in [] the [] acarbose [] group [] ( [] 31 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] % [] vs [] 8 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] % [] , [] p ['PvalueDiff'] < ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 01 ['PvalueDiff'] . []
Moreover [] , [] the ['ObservedResult'] standard ['ObservedResult'] deviation ['ObservedResult'] and ['ObservedResult'] MAGE ['ObservedResult'] values ['ObservedResult'] were ['ObservedResult'] significantly ['ObservedResult'] lower ['ObservedResult'] in ['ObservedResult'] the ['ObservedResult'] acarbose ['ObservedResult'] group ['ObservedResult'] . []
The ['ObservedResult'] MODD ['ObservedResult'] value ['ObservedResult'] was ['ObservedResult'] not ['ObservedResult'] significantly ['ObservedResult'] changed ['ObservedResult'] in ['ObservedResult'] either ['ObservedResult'] group ['ObservedResult'] , ['ObservedResult'] and ['ObservedResult'] no ['ObservedResult'] significant ['ObservedResult'] differences ['ObservedResult'] were ['ObservedResult'] recorded ['ObservedResult'] between ['ObservedResult'] groups ['ObservedResult'] . ['ObservedResult']
All ['ObservedResult'] adverse ['ObservedResult'] events ['ObservedResult'] were ['ObservedResult'] mild ['ObservedResult'] in ['ObservedResult'] both ['ObservedResult'] groups ['ObservedResult'] , [] with [] only [] a [] significantly [] greater [] frequency [] of [] flatulence [] noted [] in [] the [] acarbose [] group [] ( [] 5 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] with [] acarbose [] vs [] 0 ['PercentageAffected'] . ['PercentageAffected'] 5 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] with [] placebo [] , [] p ['PvalueDiff'] < ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 05 ['PvalueDiff'] ) [] . []
CONCLUSION [] : [] The ['ConclusionComment'] addition ['ConclusionComment'] of ['ConclusionComment'] acarbose ['ConclusionComment'] to ['ConclusionComment'] metformin ['ConclusionComment'] and ['ConclusionComment'] vildagliptin ['ConclusionComment'] background ['ConclusionComment'] therapy ['ConclusionComment'] in ['ConclusionComment'] patients ['ConclusionComment'] with ['ConclusionComment'] inadequately ['ConclusionComment'] controlled ['ConclusionComment'] type ['ConclusionComment'] 2 ['ConclusionComment'] diabetes ['ConclusionComment'] decreased ['ConclusionComment'] intraday ['ConclusionComment'] glycemic ['ConclusionComment'] variability ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] especially ['ConclusionComment'] postprandial ['ConclusionComment'] variability ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] but ['ConclusionComment'] it ['ConclusionComment'] was ['ConclusionComment'] not ['ConclusionComment'] associated ['ConclusionComment'] with ['ConclusionComment'] a ['ConclusionComment'] significant ['ConclusionComment'] change ['ConclusionComment'] in ['ConclusionComment'] interday ['ConclusionComment'] glycemic ['ConclusionComment'] variability ['ConclusionComment'] .

BACKGROUND [] : [] We ['ObjectiveDescription'] investigated ['ObjectiveDescription'] whether ['ObjectiveDescription'] metformin ['ObjectiveDescription'] hydrochloride ['ObjectiveDescription'] has ['ObjectiveDescription'] sustained ['ObjectiveDescription'] beneficial ['ObjectiveDescription'] metabolic ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] ( ['ObjectiveDescription'] cardio ['ObjectiveDescription'] ) ['ObjectiveDescription'] vascular ['ObjectiveDescription'] effects ['ObjectiveDescription'] in ['ObjectiveDescription'] patients ['ObjectiveDescription'] with ['ObjectiveDescription'] type ['ObjectiveDescription'] 2 ['ObjectiveDescription'] diabetes ['ObjectiveDescription'] mellitus ['ObjectiveDescription'] ( ['ObjectiveDescription'] DM2 ['ObjectiveDescription'] ) ['ObjectiveDescription'] . ['ObjectiveDescription']
METHODS [] : [] We [] studied [] 390 ['NumberPatientsCT'] patients ['Precondition'] treated ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] insulin ['Precondition'] in [] the [] outpatient [] clinics [] of [] 3 [] hospitals [] in [] a [] randomized [] , [] placebo [] - [] controlled [] trial [] with [] a [] follow [] - [] up [] period [] of [] 4 [] .

Either [] metformin [] hydrochloride [] , [] 850 ['DoseValue'] mg [] , [] or [] placebo [] ( [] 1 ['Frequency'] - ['Frequency'] 3 ['Frequency'] times ['Frequency'] daily ['Frequency'] ) [] was [] added [] to [] insulin [] therapy [] . []
The [] primary [] end [] point [] was [] an [] aggregate [] of [] microvascular [] and [] macrovascular [] morbidity [] and [] mortality [] . []
The [] secondary [] end [] points [] were [] microvascular [] and [] macrovascular [] morbidity [] and [] mortality [] , [] as [] separate [] aggregate [] scores [] . []
In [] addition [] , [] effects [] on [] hemoglobin [] A [] ( [] 1c [] ) [] ( [] HbA [] ( [] 1c [] ) [] ) [] , [] insulin [] requirement [] , [] lipid [] levels [] , [] blood [] pressure [] , [] body [] weight [] , [] and [] body [] mass [] index [] were [] analyzed [] . []

CONCLUSIONS [] : [] Metformin ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] added ['ConclusionComment'] to ['ConclusionComment'] insulin ['ConclusionComment'] in ['ConclusionComment'] patients ['ConclusionComment'] with ['ConclusionComment'] DM2 ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] improved ['ConclusionComment'] body ['ConclusionComment'] weight ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] glycemic ['ConclusionComment'] control ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] and ['ConclusionComment'] insulin ['ConclusionComment'] requirements ['ConclusionComment'] but ['ConclusionComment'] did ['ConclusionComment'] not ['ConclusionComment'] improve ['ConclusionComment'] the ['ConclusionComment'] primary ['ConclusionComment'] end ['ConclusionComment'] point ['ConclusionComment'] . ['ConclusionComment']
Metformin ['ConclusionComment'] did ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] however ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] reduce ['ConclusionComment'] the ['ConclusionComment'] risk ['ConclusionComment'] of ['ConclusionComment'] macrovascular ['ConclusionComment'] disease ['ConclusionComment'] after ['ConclusionComment'] a ['ConclusionComment'] follow ['ConclusionComment'] - ['ConclusionComment'] up ['ConclusionComment'] period ['ConclusionComment'] of ['ConclusionComment'] 4 ['ConclusionComment'] . ['ConclusionComment'] 3 ['ConclusionComment'] years ['ConclusionComment'] . ['ConclusionComment']
These ['ConclusionComment'] sustained ['ConclusionComment'] beneficial ['ConclusionComment'] effects ['ConclusionComment'] support ['ConclusionComment'] the ['ConclusionComment'] policy ['ConclusionComment'] to ['ConclusionComment'] continue ['ConclusionComment'] metformin ['ConclusionComment'] treatment ['ConclusionComment'] after ['ConclusionComment'] the ['ConclusionComment'] introduction ['ConclusionComment'] of ['ConclusionComment'] insulin ['ConclusionComment'] in ['ConclusionComment'] any ['ConclusionComment'] patient ['ConclusionComment'] with ['ConclusionComment'] DM2 ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] unless ['ConclusionComment'] contraindicated ['ConclusionComment'] .

BACKGROUND [] : [] Exenatide [] therapy [] is [] effective [] in [] combination [] with [] metformin [] or [] sulfonylureas [] for [] treating [] type [] 2 [] diabetes [] . []
Thiazolidinediones [] ( [] TZDs [] ) [] also [] are [] commonly [] used [] , [] but [] the [] efficacy [] of [] exenatide [] with [] a [] TZD [] has [] not [] been [] reported [] . []
OBJECTIVE [] : [] To ['ObjectiveDescription'] compare ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] effects ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] exenatide ['ObjectiveDescription'] versus ['ObjectiveDescription'] placebo ['ObjectiveDescription'] on ['ObjectiveDescription'] glycemic ['ObjectiveDescription'] control ['ObjectiveDescription'] . ['ObjectiveDescription']
DESIGN [] : [] Placebo [] run [] - [] in [] , [] randomized [] , [] double [] - [] blind [] , [] placebo [] - [] controlled [] trial [] conducted [] from [] May [] 2004 [] to [] August [] 2005 [] . []
SETTING [] : [] 49 [] sites [] in [] Canada [] , [] Spain [] , [] and [] the [] United [] States [] . []
PATIENTS [] : [] 233 ['NumberPatientsCT'] ( [] exenatide [] group [] , [] n [] = [] 121 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ; [] placebo [] group [] , [] n [] = [] 112 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ) [] patients ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] type ['Precondition'] 2 ['Precondition'] diabetes ['Precondition'] that ['Precondition'] was ['Precondition'] suboptimally ['Precondition'] controlled ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] TZD ['Precondition'] treatment ['Precondition'] ( ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] or ['Precondition'] without ['Precondition'] metformin ['Precondition'] ) ['Precondition'] . []
Mean [] ( [] + [] / [] - [] SE [] ) [] baseline [] glycated [] hemoglobin [] A1c [] level [] was [] 7 [] . [] 9 [] % [] + [] / [] - [] 0 [] . [] 1 [] % [] . []
INTERVENTIONS [] : [] Subcutaneous [] abdominal [] injections [] of [] 10 ['DoseValue'] microg [] of [] exenatide [] or [] placebo [] twice ['Frequency'] daily ['Frequency'] , [] added [] to [] a [] TZD [] ( [] with [] or [] without [] metformin [] ) [] for [] 16 [] weeks [] . []
MEASUREMENTS [] : [] The [] primary [] outcome [] was [] change [] from [] baseline [] in [] hemoglobin [] A1c [] level [] . []
Other [] outcomes [] were [] fasting [] serum [] glucose [] level [] , [] body [] weight [] , [] self [] - [] monitored [] blood [] glucose [] level [] , [] and [] any [] adverse [] events [] . []
RESULTS [] : [] Exenatide [] treatment [] reduced [] hemoglobin [] A [] ( [] 1c [] ) [] level [] ( [] mean [] difference [] , [] - ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] 0 ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] .

Sixteen [] percent [] of [] patients [] in [] the [] exenatide [] group [] and [] 2 [] % [] of [] patients [] in [] the [] placebo [] group [] discontinued [] treatment [] because [] of [] adverse [] events [] . []
In [] the [] exenatide [] group [] , [] 40 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] ( [] n [] = [] 48 ['NumberAffected'] ) [] of [] patients [] experienced [] nausea [] ( [] mostly ['SubGroupDescription'] mild ['SubGroupDescription'] [ [] n [] = [] 21 ['NumberAffected'] ] [] or [] moderate ['SubGroupDescription'] [ [] n [] = [] 19 ['NumberAffected'] ] [] ) [] , [] 13 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] experienced [] vomiting [] , [] and [] 11 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] experienced [] hypoglycemia [] . []
In [] the [] placebo [] group [] , [] 15 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] of [] patients [] experienced [] nausea [] , [] 1 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] experienced [] vomiting [] , [] and [] 7 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] experienced [] hypoglycemia [] . []
LIMITATIONS [] : [] Combinations [] with [] TZDs [] and [] sulfonylureas [] were [] not [] tested [] . []
Trial [] duration [] was [] relatively [] short [] . []
Only [] 71 [] % [] and [] 86 [] % [] of [] patients [] in [] the [] exenatide [] and [] placebo [] groups [] , [] respectively [] , [] completed [] the [] study [] . []
CONCLUSIONS [] : [] Exenatide ['ConclusionComment'] therapy ['ConclusionComment'] improved ['ConclusionComment'] glycemic ['ConclusionComment'] control ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] reduced ['ConclusionComment'] body ['ConclusionComment'] weight ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] and ['ConclusionComment'] caused ['ConclusionComment'] gastrointestinal ['ConclusionComment'] symptoms ['ConclusionComment'] more ['ConclusionComment'] than ['ConclusionComment'] placebo ['ConclusionComment'] in ['ConclusionComment'] patients ['ConclusionComment'] with ['ConclusionComment'] type ['ConclusionComment'] 2 ['ConclusionComment'] diabetes ['ConclusionComment'] that ['ConclusionComment'] was ['ConclusionComment'] suboptimally ['ConclusionComment'] controlled ['ConclusionComment'] with ['ConclusionComment'] TZD ['ConclusionComment'] therapy ['ConclusionComment'] .

['ObjectiveDescription']
RESEARCH [] DESIGN [] AND [] METHODS [] : [] A [] total [] of [] 518 [] subjects ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] type ['Precondition'] 2 ['Precondition'] diabetes ['Precondition'] who ['Precondition'] were ['Precondition'] receiving ['Precondition'] NPH ['Precondition'] insulin ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] or ['Precondition'] without ['Precondition'] regular ['Precondition'] insulin ['Precondition'] for ['Precondition'] postprandial ['Precondition'] control ['Precondition'] were [] randomized [] to [] receive [] insulin [] glargine [] ( [] HOE [] 901 [] ) [] once ['Frequency'] daily ['Frequency'] ( [] n [] = [] 259 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ) [] or [] NPH [] insulin [] once ['Frequency'] or ['Frequency'] twice ['Frequency'] daily ['Frequency'] in [] = [] 259 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ) [] for [] 28 [] weeks [] in [] an [] open [] - [] label [] , [] multicenter [] trial [] . []
Doses ['DoseDescription'] were ['DoseDescription'] adjusted ['DoseDescription'] to ['DoseDescription'] obtain ['DoseDescription'] target ['DoseDescription'] fasting ['DoseDescription'] glucose ['DoseDescription'] < ['DoseDescription'] 6 ['DoseDescription'] . ['DoseDescription'] 7 ['DoseDescription'] mmol ['DoseDescription'] / ['DoseDescription'] l ['DoseDescription'] . ['DoseDescription']
At [] study [] end [] point [] , [] the [] median [] total [] daily [] insulin [] dose [] in [] both [] treatment [] groups [] was [] 0 [] . [] 75 [] IU [] / [] kg [] . []
RESULTS [] : [] The [] treatment [] groups [] showed [] similar [] improvements [] in [] HbA1c [] from [] baseline [] to [] end [] point [] on [] intent [] - [] to [] - [] treat [] analysis [] . []
The [] mean [] change [] ( [] means [] + [] / [] - [] SD [] ) [] in [] HbA1c [] from [] baseline [] to [] end [] point [] was [] similar [] in [] the [] insulin [] glargine [] group [] ( [] - [] 0 [] .

aminorroaya [] @ [] med [] . [] mui [] . [] ac [] . [] ir [] BACKGROUND [] : [] Various [] oral [] hypoglycemic [] agents [] have [] already [] been [] administered [] to [] type [] - [] 2 [] diabetic [] patients [] to [] normalize [] their [] plasma [] glucose [] concentrations [] but [] they [] have [] not [] had [] complete [] and [] sustained [] success [] . []
In [] recent [] years [] , [] bromocriptine [] has [] been [] tried [] with [] controversial [] results [] . []
In [] present [] study [] , [] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] effect ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] bromocriptine ['ObjectiveDescription'] on ['ObjectiveDescription'] glycemic ['ObjectiveDescription'] control ['ObjectiveDescription'] was ['ObjectiveDescription'] evaluated ['ObjectiveDescription'] in ['ObjectiveDescription'] obese ['ObjectiveDescription'] type ['ObjectiveDescription'] - ['ObjectiveDescription'] 2 ['ObjectiveDescription'] diabetic ['ObjectiveDescription'] patients ['ObjectiveDescription'] . []
METHODS [] : [] In [] a [] double [] - [] blind [] placebo [] - [] controlled [] clinical [] trial [] , [] 40 ['NumberPatientsCT'] obese ['Precondition'] patients ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] type ['Precondition'] - ['Precondition'] 2 ['Precondition'] diabetes ['Precondition'] ( [] aged [] 32 ['MinAge'] - [] 70 [] years [] ) [] were [] randomly [] allocated [] to [] the [] two [] treatment [] groups [] . []
The [] first [] group [] received [] bromocriptine [] ( [] 2 ['DoseValue'] . ['DoseValue'] 5 ['DoseValue'] mg [] daily ['Frequency'] ) [] for [] a [] total [] of [] 3 [] months [] . []
The [] second [] group [] received [] placebo [] . []
They [] had [] been [] uncontrolled ['Precondition'] on ['Precondition'] fixed ['Precondition'] doses ['Precondition'] of ['Precondition'] glibenclamide ['Precondition'] or ['Precondition'] its ['Precondition'] combination ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] metformin ['Precondition'] in ['Precondition'] the ['Precondition'] 3 ['Precondition'] months ['Precondition'] before ['Precondition'] enrolling ['Precondition'] in ['Precondition'] the ['Precondition'] study ['Precondition'] . []
The [] fasting [] plasma [] glucose [] ( [] FPG [] ) [] level [] and [] glycosylated [] hemoglobin [] ( [] HbA1 [] ) [] were [] measured [] and [] body [] mass [] index [] ( [] BMI [] ) [] was [] calculated [] before [] and [] 1 [] , [] 2 [] and [] 3 [] months [] after [] treatment [] . []
RESULTS [] : [] The [] FPG [] level [] decreased [] in [] the [] bromocriptine [] - [] treated [] group [] from [] 10 [] . [] 59 [] + [] / [] - [] 0 [] . [] 42 [] to [] 9 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] . ['ResultMeasuredValue'] 06 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] + [] / [] - [] 0 [] . [] 41 [] mmol [] / [] l [] ( [] mean [] + [] / [] - [] SEM [] ; [] p ['PValueChangeValue'] < ['PValueChangeValue'] 0 ['PValueChangeValue'] . ['PValueChangeValue'] 01 ['PValueChangeValue'] ) [] , [] whereas [] in [] the [] placebo [] group [] it [] was [] not [] changed [] , [] 10 [] . [] 69 [] + [] / [] - [] 0 [] . [] 52 [] and [] 10 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] . ['ResultMeasuredValue'] 6 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] + [] / [] - [] 0 [] . [] 57 [] mmol [] / [] l [] , [] respectively [] . []
The [] HbA1 [] concentration [] was [] reduced [] in [] the [] bromocriptine [] - [] treated [] group [] from [] 9 [] . [] 9 [] + [] / [] - [] 0 [] . [] 3 [] to [] 9 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] . ['ResultMeasuredValue'] 5 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] + [] / [] - [] 0 [] . [] 2 [] % [] ( [] p ['PValueChangeValue'] = ['PValueChangeValue'] 0 ['PValueChangeValue'] . ['PValueChangeValue'] 06 ['PValueChangeValue'] ) [] , [] whereas [] it [] increased [] in [] the [] placebo [] - [] treated [] group [] from [] 10 [] . [] 2 [] + [] / [] - [] 0 [] . [] 3 [] to [] 11 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] . ['ResultMeasuredValue'] 3 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] + [] / [] - [] 0 [] . [] 6 [] % [] ( [] p ['PValueChangeValue'] < ['PValueChangeValue'] 0 ['PValueChangeValue'] . ['PValueChangeValue'] 05 ['PValueChangeValue'] ) [] . []
The [] differences [] in [] HbA1 [] ( [] 1 ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] . ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] 8 ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] % [] , [] p [] < [] 0 [] . [] 01 [] ) [] and [] FPG [] ( [] 1 [] . [] 55 [] mmol [] / [] l [] , [] p [] < [] 0 [] . [] 05 [] ) [] levels [] between [] the [] bromocriptine [] and [] placebo [] groups [] at [] 3 [] months [] were [] significant [] . []
No ['ObservedResult'] changes ['ObservedResult'] in ['ObservedResult'] body ['ObservedResult'] weight ['ObservedResult'] or ['ObservedResult'] BMI ['ObservedResult'] occurred ['ObservedResult'] during ['ObservedResult'] the ['ObservedResult'] study ['ObservedResult'] in ['ObservedResult'] either ['ObservedResult'] placebo ['ObservedResult'] - ['ObservedResult'] or ['ObservedResult'] bromocriptine ['ObservedResult'] - ['ObservedResult'] treated ['ObservedResult'] group ['ObservedResult'] . ['ObservedResult']
CONCLUSION [] : [] The ['ConclusionComment'] data ['ConclusionComment'] further ['ConclusionComment'] support ['ConclusionComment'] the ['ConclusionComment'] contention ['ConclusionComment'] that ['ConclusionComment'] bromocriptine ['ConclusionComment'] improves ['ConclusionComment'] glycemic ['ConclusionComment'] control ['ConclusionComment'] in ['ConclusionComment'] obese ['ConclusionComment'] type ['ConclusionComment'] - ['ConclusionComment'] 2 ['ConclusionComment'] diabetic ['ConclusionComment'] patients ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] although ['ConclusionComment'] the ['ConclusionComment'] mechanism ['ConclusionComment'] of ['ConclusionComment'] action ['ConclusionComment'] remains ['ConclusionComment'] to ['ConclusionComment'] be ['ConclusionComment'] determined ['ConclusionComment'] .

FPG [] improved [] from [] 10 [] . [] 8 [] to [] 7 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] . ['ResultMeasuredValue'] 1 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] and [] 7 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] . ['ResultMeasuredValue'] 0 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] mmol [] / [] l [] ( [] NS [] ) [] , [] respectively [] . []
With [] detemir [] , [] 45 [] % [] of [] participants [] completed [] the [] study [] on [] once [] daily [] dosing [] and [] 55 [] % [] on [] twice [] daily [] dosing [] , [] with [] no [] difference [] in [] HbA [] ( [] 1c [] ) [] . []
Overall [] , [] 52 [] % [] of [] participants [] achieved [] HbA [] ( [] 1c [] ) [] < [] or [] = [] 7 [] . [] 0 [] % [] : [] 33 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] ( [] detemir [] ) [] and [] 35 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] ( [] glargine [] ) [] without [] hypoglycaemia [] . []
Within [] - [] participant [] variability [] for [] self [] - [] monitored [] FPG [] and [] pre [] - [] dinner [] PG [] did [] not [] differ [] by [] insulin [] treatment [] , [] nor [] did [] the [] relative [] risk [] of [] overall [] or [] nocturnal [] hypoglycaemia [] . []
Modest [] reductions [] in [] weight [] gain [] were [] seen [] with [] detemir [] vs [] glargine [] in [] completers ['SubGroupDescription'] ( [] 3 [] . [] 0 [] vs [] 3 [] .

BACKGROUND [] : [] Achievement [] of [] glycemic [] control [] is [] an [] important [] objective [] in [] the [] management [] of [] type [] 2 [] diabetes [] mellitus [] ( [] T2DM [] ) [] . []
OBJECTIVE [] : [] The ['ObjectiveDescription'] objective ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] this ['ObjectiveDescription'] study ['ObjectiveDescription'] was ['ObjectiveDescription'] to ['ObjectiveDescription'] evaluate ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] safety ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] efficacy ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] dipeptidyl ['ObjectiveDescription'] peptidase ['ObjectiveDescription'] - ['ObjectiveDescription'] 4 ['ObjectiveDescription'] inhibitor ['ObjectiveDescription'] saxagliptin ['ObjectiveDescription'] versus ['ObjectiveDescription'] placebo ['ObjectiveDescription'] as ['ObjectiveDescription'] add ['ObjectiveDescription'] - ['ObjectiveDescription'] on ['ObjectiveDescription'] therapy ['ObjectiveDescription'] in ['ObjectiveDescription'] patients ['Precondition', 'ObjectiveDescription'] with ['Precondition', 'ObjectiveDescription'] T2DM ['Precondition', 'ObjectiveDescription'] inadequately ['Precondition', 'ObjectiveDescription'] controlled ['Precondition', 'ObjectiveDescription'] with ['Precondition', 'ObjectiveDescription'] insulin ['Precondition', 'ObjectiveDescription'] alone ['Precondition', 'ObjectiveDescription'] or ['Precondition', 'ObjectiveDescription'] insulin ['Precondition', 'ObjectiveDescription'] plus ['Precondition', 'ObjectiveDescription'] metformin ['Precondition', 'ObjectiveDescription'] . ['ObjectiveDescription']
METHODS [] : [] This [] was [] a [] long [] - [] term [] ( [] 28 [] - [] week [] ) [] extension [] of [] a [] short [] - [] term [] ( [] 24 [] - [] week [] ) [] , [] randomized [] , [] double [] - [] blind [] , [] parallel [] - [] group [] trial [] of [] saxagliptin [] 5 ['DoseValue'] mg [] once [] daily [] versus [] placebo [] as [] add [] - [] on [] therapy [] to [] open [] - [] label [] insulin [] or [] insulin [] plus [] metformin [] therapy [] totaling [] 52 [] weeks [] of [] treatment [] . []
In [] contrast [] with [] the [] goal [] of [] maintaining [] a [] stable [] insulin [] dosage [] during [] the [] short [] - [] term [] phase [] , [] during [] the [] extension [] phase [] the [] insulin [] dosage [] was [] flexible [] and [] adjusted [] as [] deemed [] appropriate [] by [] the [] investigator [] . []
The [] study [] was [] conducted [] in [] a [] clinical [] practice [] setting [] , [] including [] family [] practice [] and [] hospital [] sites [] . []
Patients ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] T2DM ['Precondition'] aged ['Precondition'] 18 ['MinAge', 'Precondition'] - ['Precondition'] 78 ['Precondition'] years ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] glycated ['Precondition'] hemoglobin ['Precondition'] ( ['Precondition'] HbA1c ['Precondition'] ) ['Precondition'] 7 ['Precondition'] . ['Precondition'] 5 ['Precondition'] - ['Precondition'] 11 ['Precondition'] % ['Precondition'] on ['Precondition'] a ['Precondition'] stable ['Precondition'] insulin ['Precondition'] regimen ['Precondition'] ( ['Precondition'] 30 ['Precondition'] - ['Precondition'] 150 ['Precondition'] U ['Precondition'] / ['Precondition'] day ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] or ['Precondition'] without ['Precondition'] metformin ['Precondition'] ) ['Precondition'] for ['Precondition'] ≥ ['Precondition'] 8 ['Precondition'] weeks ['Precondition'] at ['Precondition'] screening ['Precondition'] were [] included [] in [] the [] study [] . []
Patients [] were [] stratified [] by [] metformin [] use [] and [] randomly [] assigned [] 2 ['AllocationRatio'] : ['AllocationRatio'] 1 ['AllocationRatio'] to [] oral [] saxagliptin [] 5 [] mg [] ( [] n [] = [] 304 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ) [] or [] placebo [] ( [] n [] = [] 151 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ) [] once ['Frequency'] daily ['Frequency'] . []
All [] patients [] who [] completed [] the [] initial [] 24 [] weeks [] of [] treatment [] were [] eligible [] to [] participate [] in [] the [] 28 [] - [] week [] extension [] , [] regardless [] of [] whether [] they [] had [] required [] rescue [] treatment [] . []
The [] main [] outcome [] measure [] was [] change [] in [] HbA1c [] from [] baseline [] to [] week [] 52 [] . []
RESULTS [] : [] In [] general [] , [] the [] outcomes [] achieved [] at [] week [] 24 [] were [] sustained [] to [] week [] 52 [] . []
Adjusted [] mean [] change [] from [] baseline [] HbA1c [] at [] week ['TimePoint'] 52 ['TimePoint'] was [] greater [] with [] saxagliptin [] ( [] - [] 0 [] .

PURPOSE [] : [] The ['ObjectiveDescription'] objective ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] this ['ObjectiveDescription'] clinical ['ObjectiveDescription'] trial ['ObjectiveDescription'] was ['ObjectiveDescription'] to ['ObjectiveDescription'] assess ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] efficacy ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] safety ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] omarigliptin ['ObjectiveDescription'] monotherapy ['ObjectiveDescription'] in ['ObjectiveDescription'] young ['ObjectiveDescription'] adult ['ObjectiveDescription'] patients ['ObjectiveDescription'] with ['ObjectiveDescription'] type ['ObjectiveDescription'] 2 ['ObjectiveDescription'] diabetes ['ObjectiveDescription'] mellitus ['ObjectiveDescription'] ( ['ObjectiveDescription'] T2DM ['ObjectiveDescription'] ) ['ObjectiveDescription'] . ['ObjectiveDescription']
Unexpected [] efficacy [] results [] in [] this [] trial [] led [] to [] a [] series [] of [] investigations [] that [] identified [] the [] use [] of [] prohibited [] medication [] by [] a [] substantial [] number [] of [] trial [] patients [] . []
METHODS [] : [] Patients ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] T2DM ['Precondition'] who ['Precondition'] were ['Precondition'] ≥ ['Precondition'] 18 ['Precondition'] to ['Precondition'] < ['Precondition'] 45 ['Precondition'] years ['Precondition'] of ['Precondition'] age ['Precondition'] and ['Precondition'] either ['Precondition'] drug ['Precondition'] - ['Precondition'] naive ['Precondition'] or ['Precondition'] not ['Precondition'] on ['Precondition'] an ['Precondition'] antihyperglycemic ['Precondition'] agent ['Precondition'] for ['Precondition'] ≥ ['Precondition'] 12 ['Precondition'] weeks ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] inadequate ['Precondition'] glycemic ['Precondition'] control ['Precondition'] were [] randomized [] in [] a [] double [] - [] blind [] manner [] to [] receive [] omarigliptin [] 25 ['DoseValue'] mg [] once ['Frequency'] weekly ['Frequency'] ( [] n [] = [] 102 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ) [] or [] placebo [] once ['Frequency'] weekly ['Frequency'] ( [] n [] = [] 101 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ) [] for [] 24 [] weeks [] . []
The ['ObjectiveDescription'] objectives ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] trial ['ObjectiveDescription'] were ['ObjectiveDescription'] to ['ObjectiveDescription'] assess ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] effect ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] treatment ['ObjectiveDescription'] with ['ObjectiveDescription'] omarigliptin ['ObjectiveDescription'] on ['ObjectiveDescription'] glycemic ['ObjectiveDescription'] parameters ['ObjectiveDescription'] , ['ObjectiveDescription'] including ['ObjectiveDescription'] levels ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] glycosylated ['ObjectiveDescription'] hemoglobin ['ObjectiveDescription'] ( ['ObjectiveDescription'] HbA1c ['ObjectiveDescription'] ) ['ObjectiveDescription'] , ['ObjectiveDescription'] 2 ['ObjectiveDescription'] - ['ObjectiveDescription'] hour ['ObjectiveDescription'] postmeal ['ObjectiveDescription'] glucose ['ObjectiveDescription'] , ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] fasting ['ObjectiveDescription'] plasma ['ObjectiveDescription'] glucose ['ObjectiveDescription'] , ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] to ['ObjectiveDescription'] assess ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] safety ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] tolerability ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] omarigliptin ['ObjectiveDescription'] . ['ObjectiveDescription']
Additional [] investigations [] into [] trial [] conduct [] included [] the [] measurement [] of [] drug [] levels [] for [] omarigliptin [] and [] metformin [] in [] blood [] samples [] collected [] for [] future [] biomedical [] research [] , [] available [] for [] approximately [] one [] half [] of [] the [] patients [] . []
FINDINGS [] : [] The [] mean [] age [] of [] trial [] participants [] was [] 39 ['AvgAge'] . ['AvgAge'] 2 ['AvgAge'] years [] , [] approximately [] 60 [] % [] were [] male [] , [] mean [] body [] mass [] index [] was [] 32 [] . [] 5 [] kg [] / [] m2 [] , [] and [] mean [] duration [] of [] diabetes [] was [] 3 [] . [] 1 [] years [] . []
The [] mean [] baseline [] HbA1c [] value [] was [] 7 [] . [] 9 [] % [] in [] the [] omarigliptin [] group [] and [] 8 [] . [] 1 [] % [] in [] the [] placebo [] group [] . []
After [] 24 ['TimePoint'] weeks ['TimePoint'] , [] the [] least [] squares []  [] mean [] change [] ( [] 95 [] % [] CI [] ) [] in [] HbA1c [] value [] from [] baseline [] was [] - [] 0 [] . [] 33 [] % [] ( [] - ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] 0 ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] . ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] 60 ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] to ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] - ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] 0 ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] . ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] 06 ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] ) [] in [] the [] omarigliptin [] group [] and [] - [] 0 [] . [] 45 [] % [] ( [] - ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] 0 ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] . ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] 72 ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] to ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] - ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] 0 ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] . ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] 18 ['ConfIntervalChangeValue'] ) [] in [] the [] placebo [] group [] , [] with [] a [] between [] - [] group [] difference [] of [] 0 ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] . ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] 12 ['DiffGroupAbsValue'] % [] ( [] - ['ConfIntervalDiff'] 0 ['ConfIntervalDiff'] . ['ConfIntervalDiff'] 26 ['ConfIntervalDiff'] to ['ConfIntervalDiff'] 0 ['ConfIntervalDiff'] . ['ConfIntervalDiff'] 49 ['ConfIntervalDiff'] ; [] P ['PvalueDiff'] = ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 535 ['PvalueDiff'] ) [] . []
Similarly [] , [] no [] between [] - [] group [] difference [] was [] observed [] for [] the [] other [] glycemic [] parameters [] ( [] 2 [] - [] hour [] postmeal [] glucose [] and [] fasting [] plasma [] glucose [] levels [] ) [] . []
No [] issues [] were [] identified [] in [] drug [] allocation [] , [] dispensing [] or [] supply [] , [] patient [] compliance [] with [] trial [] medication [] , [] sample [] handling [] or [] analysis [] , [] or [] site [] trial [] conduct [] that [] explained [] the [] observed [] results [] . []
Measurement [] of [] drug [] levels [] from [] future [] biomedical [] research [] samples [] uncovered [] the [] use [] , [] with [] no [] investigator [] knowledge [] , [] of [] an [] antihyperglycemic [] agent [] that [] was [] prohibited [] by [] the [] protocol [] ( [] ie [] , [] metformin [] ) [] by [] 42 [] . [] 4 [] % [] ( [] 39 [] of [] 92 [] ) [] of [] patients [] . []
Metformin [] was [] used [] by [] more [] patients [] in [] the [] placebo [] group [] ( [] 57 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] [ [] 25 ['NumberAffected'] of [] 44 ['FinalNumPatientsArm'] ] [] ) [] than [] in [] the [] omarigliptin [] group [] ( [] 29 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] [ [] 14 ['NumberAffected'] of [] 48 ['FinalNumPatientsArm'] ] [] ) [] . []
IMPLICATIONS [] : [] The ['ConclusionComment'] use ['ConclusionComment'] of ['ConclusionComment'] prohibited ['ConclusionComment'] metformin ['ConclusionComment'] in ['ConclusionComment'] a ['ConclusionComment'] trial ['ConclusionComment'] of ['ConclusionComment'] a ['ConclusionComment'] dipeptidyl ['ConclusionComment'] peptidase ['ConclusionComment'] - ['ConclusionComment'] 4 ['ConclusionComment']  ['ConclusionComment'] inhibitor ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] omarigliptin ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] introduced ['ConclusionComment'] a ['ConclusionComment'] confounding ['ConclusionComment'] factor ['ConclusionComment'] that ['ConclusionComment'] invalidated ['ConclusionComment'] the ['ConclusionComment'] results ['ConclusionComment'] of ['ConclusionComment'] the ['ConclusionComment'] trial ['ConclusionComment'] . ['ConclusionComment']
This ['ConclusionComment'] behavior ['ConclusionComment'] may ['ConclusionComment'] have ['ConclusionComment'] been ['ConclusionComment'] encouraged ['ConclusionComment'] in ['ConclusionComment'] the ['ConclusionComment'] trial ['ConclusionComment'] by ['ConclusionComment'] protocol ['ConclusionComment'] - ['ConclusionComment'] specified ['ConclusionComment'] self ['ConclusionComment'] - ['ConclusionComment'] monitoring ['ConclusionComment'] of ['ConclusionComment'] blood ['ConclusionComment'] glucose ['ConclusionComment'] levels ['ConclusionComment'] . ['ConclusionComment']
Use ['ConclusionComment'] of ['ConclusionComment'] prohibited ['ConclusionComment'] medication ['ConclusionComment'] may ['ConclusionComment'] be ['ConclusionComment'] an ['ConclusionComment'] underappreciated ['ConclusionComment'] confounder ['ConclusionComment'] in ['ConclusionComment'] clinical ['ConclusionComment'] trial ['ConclusionComment'] research ['ConclusionComment'] .

OBJECTIVE [] : [] To ['ObjectiveDescription'] evaluate ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] efficacy ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] tolerability ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] sitagliptin ['ObjectiveDescription'] when ['ObjectiveDescription'] added ['ObjectiveDescription'] to ['ObjectiveDescription'] insulin ['ObjectiveDescription'] therapy ['ObjectiveDescription'] alone ['ObjectiveDescription'] or ['ObjectiveDescription'] in ['ObjectiveDescription'] combination ['ObjectiveDescription'] with ['ObjectiveDescription'] metformin ['ObjectiveDescription'] in ['ObjectiveDescription'] patients ['ObjectiveDescription'] with ['ObjectiveDescription'] type ['ObjectiveDescription'] 2 ['ObjectiveDescription'] diabetes ['ObjectiveDescription'] . ['ObjectiveDescription']
METHODS [] : [] After [] a [] 2 [] week [] placebo [] run [] - [] in [] period [] , [] eligible [] patients ['Precondition'] inadequately ['Precondition'] controlled ['Precondition'] on ['Precondition'] long ['Precondition'] - ['Precondition'] acting ['Precondition'] , ['Precondition'] intermediate ['Precondition'] - ['Precondition'] acting ['Precondition'] or ['Precondition'] premixed ['Precondition'] insulin ['Precondition'] ( ['Precondition'] HbA1c ['Precondition'] > ['Precondition'] or ['Precondition'] = ['Precondition'] 7 ['Precondition'] . ['Precondition'] 5 ['Precondition'] % ['Precondition'] and ['Precondition'] < ['Precondition'] or ['Precondition'] = ['Precondition'] 11 ['Precondition'] % ['Precondition'] ) ['Precondition'] , [] were [] randomised [] 1 ['AllocationRatio'] : ['AllocationRatio'] 1 ['AllocationRatio'] to [] the [] addition [] of [] once ['Frequency'] - ['Frequency'] daily ['Frequency'] sitagliptin [] 100 ['DoseValue'] mg [] or [] matching [] placebo [] over [] a [] 24 [] - [] week [] study [] period [] . []
The [] study [] capped [] the [] proportion [] of [] randomised [] patients [] on [] insulin [] plus [] metformin [] at [] 75 [] % [] . []
Further [] , [] the [] study [] capped [] the [] proportion [] of [] randomised [] patients [] on [] premixed [] insulin [] at [] 25 [] % [] . []
The [] metformin [] dose [] and [] the [] insulin [] dose [] were [] to [] remain [] stable [] throughout [] the [] study [] . []
The [] primary [] endpoint [] was [] HbA1c [] change [] from [] baseline [] at [] week [] 24 [] . []
RESULTS [] : [] Mean [] baseline [] characteristics [] were [] similar [] between [] the [] sitagliptin [] ( [] n [] = [] 322 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ) [] and [] placebo [] ( [] n [] = [] 319 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ) [] groups [] , [] including [] HbA1c [] ( [] 8 [] . [] 7 [] vs [] . [] 8 [] . [] 6 [] % [] ) [] , [] diabetes [] duration [] ( [] 13 [] vs [] . [] 12 [] years [] ) [] , [] body [] mass [] index [] ( [] 31 [] . [] 4 [] vs [] . [] 31 [] . [] 4 [] kg [] / [] m [] ( [] 2 [] ) [] ) [] , [] and [] total [] daily [] insulin [] dose [] ( [] 51 [] vs [] . [] 52 [] IU [] ) [] , [] respectively [] . []
At [] 24 ['TimePoint'] weeks ['TimePoint'] , [] the [] addition [] of [] sitagliptin [] significantly [] ( [] p ['PvalueDiff'] < ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 001 ['PvalueDiff'] ) [] reduced [] HbA1c [] by [] 0 [] . [] 6 [] % [] compared [] with [] placebo [] ( [] 0 [] . [] 0 [] % [] ) [] . []
A [] greater [] proportion [] of [] patients [] achieved [] an [] HbA1c [] level [] < [] 7 [] % [] while [] randomised [] to [] sitagliptin [] as [] compared [] with [] placebo [] ( [] 13 ['PercentageAffected'] vs [] . [] 5 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] respectively [] ; [] p ['PvalueDiff'] < ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 001 ['PvalueDiff'] ) [] . []
Similar [] HbA1c [] reductions [] were [] observed [] in [] the [] patient [] strata [] defined [] by [] insulin [] type [] ( [] long [] - [] acting [] and [] intermediate [] - [] acting [] insulins [] or [] premixed [] insulins [] ) [] and [] by [] baseline [] metformin [] treatment [] . []
The [] addition [] of [] sitagliptin [] significantly [] ( [] p ['PvalueDiff'] < ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] .

BACKGROUND [] : [] In [] people [] without [] diabetes [] , [] approximately [] 50 [] % [] of [] daily [] insulin [] secretion [] is [] basal [] and [] the [] remainder [] is [] postprandial [] . []
Hence [] , [] it [] would [] be [] expected [] that [] insulin [] replacement [] therapy [] in [] a [] 50 [] / [] 50 [] ratio [] with [] each [] meal [] would [] mimic [] physiologic [] insulin [] secretion [] better [] than [] treatment [] with [] once [] - [] daily [] basal [] insulin [] in [] patients [] with [] diabetes [] mellitus [] . []
Using [] lispro [] mix [] ( [] LM [] ) [] 50 [] / [] 50 [] before [] meals [] may [] be [] a [] logical [] approach [] to [] achieving [] glycemic [] targets [] ( [] glycosylated [] hemoglobin [] [ [] HbA [] ( [] lc [] ) [] ] [] and [] pre [] - [] and [] postprandial [] blood [] glucose [] [ [] BG [] ] [] concentrations [] ) [] in [] these [] patients [] . []
OBJECTIVE [] : [] The ['ObjectiveDescription'] aim ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] this ['ObjectiveDescription'] study ['ObjectiveDescription'] was ['ObjectiveDescription'] to ['ObjectiveDescription'] test ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] hypothesis ['ObjectiveDescription'] that ['ObjectiveDescription'] treatment ['ObjectiveDescription'] with ['ObjectiveDescription'] a ['ObjectiveDescription'] premixed ['ObjectiveDescription'] insulin ['ObjectiveDescription'] analogue ['ObjectiveDescription'] containing ['ObjectiveDescription'] 50 ['ObjectiveDescription'] / ['ObjectiveDescription'] 50 ['ObjectiveDescription'] basal ['ObjectiveDescription'] + ['ObjectiveDescription'] prandial ['ObjectiveDescription'] insulins ['ObjectiveDescription'] administered ['ObjectiveDescription'] before ['ObjectiveDescription'] each ['ObjectiveDescription'] meal ['ObjectiveDescription'] would ['ObjectiveDescription'] achieve ['ObjectiveDescription'] lower ['ObjectiveDescription'] overall ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] mealtime ['ObjectiveDescription'] glycemic ['ObjectiveDescription'] control ['ObjectiveDescription'] than ['ObjectiveDescription'] once ['ObjectiveDescription'] - ['ObjectiveDescription'] daily ['ObjectiveDescription'] basal ['ObjectiveDescription'] insulin ['ObjectiveDescription'] analogue ['ObjectiveDescription'] , ['ObjectiveDescription'] both ['ObjectiveDescription'] plus ['ObjectiveDescription'] metformin ['ObjectiveDescription'] ( ['ObjectiveDescription'] Met ['ObjectiveDescription'] ) ['ObjectiveDescription'] , ['ObjectiveDescription'] in ['ObjectiveDescription'] patients ['ObjectiveDescription'] with ['ObjectiveDescription'] type ['ObjectiveDescription'] 2 ['ObjectiveDescription'] diabetes ['ObjectiveDescription'] mellitus ['ObjectiveDescription'] .

INTRODUCTION [] : [] The [] main [] causes [] of [] reduced [] glucose [] levels [] during [] metformin [] therapy [] appear [] to [] be [] an [] increase [] in [] insulin [] action [] in [] peripheral [] tissues [] and [] reduced [] hepatic [] glucose [] output [] due [] to [] inhibition [] gluconeogenesis [] . []
OBJECTIVE [] : [] The ['ObjectiveDescription'] purpose ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] study ['ObjectiveDescription'] was ['ObjectiveDescription'] to ['ObjectiveDescription'] establish ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] effect ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] metformin ['ObjectiveDescription'] on ['ObjectiveDescription'] fasting ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] postprandial ['ObjectiveDescription'] insulin ['ObjectiveDescription'] secretion ['ObjectiveDescription'] . ['ObjectiveDescription']
METHOD [] : [] The [] study [] carried [] out [] was [] double [] blind [] , [] controlled ['CTDesign'] , [] comparative ['CTDesign'] , [] randomized [] , [] multicentric [] , [] including [] two [] groups [] of [] out [] - [] patient [] department [] ( [] OPD [] ) [] patients [] . []
43 [] patients [] were [] administered [] metformin [] ( [] Tefor [] ICN [] Canada [] ) [] , [] and [] 46 ['NumberPatientsArm'] patients [] were [] given [] placebo [] . []
Patients [] enrolled [] in [] the [] study [] were [] newly ['Precondition'] diagnosed ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] diabetes ['Precondition'] mellitus ['Precondition'] ( ['Precondition'] DM ['Precondition'] ) ['Precondition'] type ['Precondition'] 2 ['Precondition'] , ['Precondition'] glycaemia ['Precondition'] < ['Precondition'] 12 ['Precondition'] mmol ['Precondition'] / ['Precondition'] l ['Precondition'] , ['Precondition'] and ['Precondition'] had ['Precondition'] the ['Precondition'] Body ['Precondition'] Mass ['Precondition'] Index ['Precondition'] ( ['Precondition'] BMI ['Precondition'] ) ['Precondition'] > ['Precondition'] 30 ['Precondition'] kg ['Precondition'] / ['Precondition'] m2 ['Precondition'] . ['Precondition']
Before [] treatment [] , [] blood [] biochemistry [] was [] done [] : [] fasting [] and [] postprandial [] glycaemia [] , [] glycosylated [] haemoglobin [] ( [] HbA1c [] ) [] value [] , [] fasting [] and [] postprandial [] insulinaemia [] , [] blood [] lipids [] ( [] total [] cholesterol [] , [] total [] triglycerides [] , [] HDL [] cholesterol [] , [] and [] LDL [] cholesterol [] ) [] , [] and [] gamma [] glutaryl [] transferase [] ( [] GGT [] ) [] level [] . []
BMI [] was [] also [] established [] . []
After [] 42 [] days [] of [] treatment [] , [] fasting [] and [] postprandial [] insulinaemia [] were [] tested [] again [] . []
Analysis [] of [] the [] effects [] of [] therapy [] , [] and [] identification [] of [] co [] - [] variants [] for [] fasting [] and [] postprandial [] insulinaemia [] , [] were [] done [] by [] ANOVA [] two [] way [] and [] ANCOVA [] method [] . []
RESULTS [] : [] It [] was [] shown [] that [] metformin [] accompanied [] by [] diet [] , [] as [] compared [] to [] placebo [] accompanied [] by [] diet [] , [] lowered [] the [] fasting [] insulinaemia [] value [] during [] six [] weeks [] of [] therapy [] in [] obese [] patients [] with [] DM [] type [] 2 [] ( [] 24 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] .

A [] significant [] effect [] of [] the [] interaction [] of [] covariants [] BMI [] and [] GGT [] was [] defined [] . []
As [] for [] the [] effect [] of [] therapy [] on [] postprandial [] insulinaemia [] , [] it [] was [] found [] that [] there [] was [] a [] high [] statistical [] significance [] of [] the [] effect [] of [] BMI [] interacting [] with [] initial [] values [] for [] postprandial [] insulinaemia [] before [] therapy [] , [] and [] interacting [] with [] therapy [] ( [] p ['PvalueDiff'] < ['PvalueDiff'] 0 ['PvalueDiff'] . ['PvalueDiff'] 01 ['PvalueDiff'] ) [] . []
Adjusted [] mean [] values [] for [] postprandial [] insulinaemia [] after [] therapy [] in [] the [] placebo [] group [] were [] lower [] as [] compared [] to [] the [] metformin [] group [] ( [] 44 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] . ['ResultMeasuredValue'] 807 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] mU [] / [] l [] vs [] . [] 47 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] . ['ResultMeasuredValue'] 114 ['ResultMeasuredValue'] mU [] / [] l [] ) [] . []

OBJECTIVE [] : [] To ['ObjectiveDescription'] evaluate ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] efficacy ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] safety ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] adding ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] once ['ObjectiveDescription'] - ['ObjectiveDescription'] weekly ['ObjectiveDescription'] DPP ['ObjectiveDescription'] - ['ObjectiveDescription'] 4 ['ObjectiveDescription'] inhibitor ['ObjectiveDescription'] omarigliptin ['ObjectiveDescription'] or ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] sulfonylurea ['ObjectiveDescription'] glimepiride ['ObjectiveDescription'] to ['ObjectiveDescription'] the ['ObjectiveDescription'] treatment ['ObjectiveDescription'] regimen ['ObjectiveDescription'] of ['ObjectiveDescription'] patients ['ObjectiveDescription'] with ['ObjectiveDescription'] type ['ObjectiveDescription'] 2 ['ObjectiveDescription'] diabetes ['ObjectiveDescription'] ( ['ObjectiveDescription'] T2DM ['ObjectiveDescription'] ) ['ObjectiveDescription'] and ['ObjectiveDescription'] inadequate ['ObjectiveDescription'] glycemic ['ObjectiveDescription'] control ['ObjectiveDescription'] on ['ObjectiveDescription'] metformin ['ObjectiveDescription'] monotherapy ['ObjectiveDescription'] . ['ObjectiveDescription']
METHODS [] : [] Patients ['Precondition'] with ['Precondition'] T2DM ['Precondition'] and ['Precondition'] HbA1c ['Precondition'] ≥ ['Precondition'] 6 ['Precondition'] . ['Precondition'] 5 ['Precondition'] % ['Precondition'] to ['Precondition'] ≤ ['Precondition'] 9 ['Precondition'] . ['Precondition'] 0 ['Precondition'] % ['Precondition'] while ['Precondition'] on ['Precondition'] a ['Precondition'] stable ['Precondition'] dose ['Precondition'] of ['Precondition'] metformin ['Precondition'] ( ['Precondition'] ≥ ['Precondition'] 1500 ['Precondition']  ['Precondition'] mg ['Precondition'] / ['Precondition'] day ['Precondition'] ) ['Precondition'] were [] randomized [] to [] omarigliptin [] 25 ['DoseValue']  [] mg [] once ['Frequency'] - ['Frequency'] weekly ['Frequency'] ( [] n [] = [] 376 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ) [] or [] glimepiride [] up ['DoseDescription'] to ['DoseDescription'] 6 ['DoseDescription', 'DoseValue']  ['DoseDescription', 'DoseValue'] mg ['DoseDescription', 'DoseValue'] once ['Frequency', 'DoseDescription'] daily ['Frequency', 'DoseDescription'] ( [] n [] = [] 375 ['NumberPatientsArm'] ) [] for [] 54 [] weeks [] . []
The [] primary [] hypothesis [] was [] that [] omarigliptin [] is [] non [] - [] inferior [] to [] glimepiride [] in [] reducing [] HbA1c [] at [] week [] 54 [] . []
RESULTS [] : [] The [] mean [] baseline [] HbA1c [] was [] 7 [] . [] 5 [] % [] in [] the [] omarigliptin [] group [] and [] 7 [] . [] 4 [] % [] in [] the [] glimepiride [] group [] . []
After [] 54 [] weeks [] , [] the [] least [] squares [] ( [] LS [] ) [] mean [] change [] from [] baseline [] in [] HbA1c [] was [] - [] 0 [] .

The [] incidence [] of [] symptomatic [] hypoglycemia [] was [] 5 ['PercentageAffected'] . ['PercentageAffected'] 3 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] in [] the [] omarigliptin [] group [] and [] 26 ['PercentageAffected'] . ['PercentageAffected'] 7 ['PercentageAffected'] % [] in [] the [] glimepiride [] group [] . []
With ['ObservedResult'] the ['ObservedResult'] exception ['ObservedResult'] of ['ObservedResult'] hypoglycemia ['ObservedResult'] , ['ObservedResult'] the ['ObservedResult'] incidences ['ObservedResult'] of ['ObservedResult'] adverse ['ObservedResult'] events ['ObservedResult'] and ['ObservedResult'] discontinuations ['ObservedResult'] were ['ObservedResult'] similar ['ObservedResult'] between ['ObservedResult'] treatment ['ObservedResult'] groups ['ObservedResult'] . []
Relative [] to [] baseline [] , [] omarigliptin [] was [] associated [] with [] a [] mean [] weight [] loss [] ( [] - [] 0 [] . [] 4 []  [] kg [] ) [] and [] glimepiride [] a [] mean [] weight [] gain [] ( [] + [] 1 [] . [] 5 []  [] kg [] ) [] . []
CONCLUSIONS [] : [] After ['ConclusionComment'] 54 ['ConclusionComment'] weeks ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] as ['ConclusionComment'] add ['ConclusionComment'] - ['ConclusionComment'] on ['ConclusionComment'] therapy ['ConclusionComment'] to ['ConclusionComment'] metformin ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] once ['ConclusionComment'] - ['ConclusionComment'] weekly ['ConclusionComment'] omarigliptin ['ConclusionComment'] was ['ConclusionComment'] generally ['ConclusionComment'] well ['ConclusionComment'] tolerated ['ConclusionComment'] and ['ConclusionComment'] non ['ConclusionComment'] - ['ConclusionComment'] inferior ['ConclusionComment'] to ['ConclusionComment'] glimepiride ['ConclusionComment'] in ['ConclusionComment'] improving ['ConclusionComment'] glycemic ['ConclusionComment'] control ['ConclusionComment'] , ['ConclusionComment'] with ['ConclusionComment'] a ['ConclusionComment'] lower ['ConclusionComment'] incidence ['ConclusionComment'] of ['ConclusionComment'] hypoglycemia ['ConclusionComment'] and ['ConclusionComment'] with ['ConclusionComment'] weight ['ConclusionComment'] loss ['ConclusionComment'] vs ['ConclusionComment'] weight ['ConclusionComment'] gain ['ConclusionComment'] .
