    insulin - treated T2D , with no increase in the rates of hypoglycaemia .

  ConclusionComment:
  - Colesevelam monotherapy resulted in statistically significant improvements in
    glycemic and most lipid parameters in subjects with type 2 diabetes , with no
    new or unexpected safety and tolerability issues .
  - Modest reductions in HbA1c and low - density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with
    colesevelam further support its use in combination with other antidiabetes agents
    when treatment targets for these parameters are close but are not quite achieved

  ObjectiveDescription:
  - We designed an experiment to examine the effect of bile acid sequestration with
    Colesevelam on fasting and postprandial glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes

  - To do so , we tested the hypothesis that Colesevelam increases the disposition
    index ( DI ) , and this increase is associated with increased glucagon - like
    peptide - 1 ( GLP - 1 ) concentrations .

  ConclusionComment:
  - With respect to HbA ( 1c ) , BIAsp 30 fulfilled the statistical criteria for non
    - inferiority and superiority to insulin glargine and , according to pre - defined
    criteria , the improvements in HbA ( 1c ) are considered clinically equivalent
    .
  - Subjects had an increased risk of minor nocturnal hypoglycemia with BIAsp 30 .
  - There were no differences in treatment satisfaction between the two groups .

  ConclusionComment:
  - In patients with Type 2 diabetes , adding linagliptin to metformin given in combination
    with a sulphonylurea significantly improved glycaemic control and this was well
    tolerated .
