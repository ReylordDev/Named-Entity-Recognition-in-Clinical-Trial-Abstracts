    "Achievements": [
        "Specified the application domain as Clinical Trial Abstracts.",
        "Disclosed the labels to recognize including 'Author, PMID, Title, etc.",
        "Shared that a pretrained DistilBERT model is being used for token classification.",
        "Stated that random sentences from the dataset of abstracts are used for input.",
        "Decided to proceed with domain-specific preprocessing for fine-tuning DistilBERT.",
        "Decided to implement preprocessing, focusing on the aspect of context incorporation.",
        "Provided a sample Clinical Trial Abstract for review and analysis.",
        "Returning to task 2: Assess how well the model currently identifies the specific labels."
