AIM : To compare the efficacy and safety of an intensified insulin regimen , using insulin glargine ( glargine ) once daily and pre - meal insulin glulisine ( glulisine ) ( basal - bolus ) , with a conventional therapy , using premixed insulin ( premix ) twice daily .
METHODS : This 52 - week , open - label , randomized , multinational , multicentre trial included 310 subjects with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) on premix , with or without metformin , who were randomized to a basal - bolus regimen with glargine and glulisine ( n = 153 ; mean + / - s . d .
age 60 . 2 + / - 7 . 5 years ; HbA1c 8 . 6 + / - 0 . 8 % ; weight 87 . 0 + / - 15 . 1 kg ; T2D duration 12 . 8 + / - 5 . 8 years ) or twice - daily premix ( n = 157 ; age 60 . 9 + / - 7 . 8 years ; HbA1c 8 . 5 + / - 0 . 9 % ; weight 84 . 3 + / - 15 . 0 kg ; T2D duration 12 . 5 + / - 6 . 8 years ) .
The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint .
RESULTS : Mean decrease in baseline - to - endpoint HbA1c for basal - bolus vs . premix was - 1 . 31 vs . - 0 . 80 % ( difference : - 0 . 476 % ; 95 % Cl : - 0 . 714 , - 0 . 238 ; p = 0 . 0001 , ancova ) .
More subjects reached HbA1c < or = 7 . 0 % in the basal - bolus group than in the premix group [ 68 ( 46 . 6 % ) vs . 43 ( 27 . 9 % ) ; p = 0 . 0004 ] , while they also experienced significantly lower mean + / - s . d .
daytime ( - 2 . 7 + / - 2 . 3 vs . - 2 . 3 + / - 2 . 5 mmol / l ; p = 0 . 0033 ) and postprandial ( - 3 . 1 + / - 2 . 6 vs . - 2 . 5 + / - 2 . 8 mmol / l ; p < 0 . 0001 ) blood glucose .
Endpoint daily insulin doses were 98 . 0 + / - 48 . 7 vs . 91 . 3 + / - 44 . 3 IU ( p = 0 . 2104 ) ; mean weight gain was + 3 . 6 + / - 4 . 0 vs . + 2 . 2 + / - 4 . 5 kg ( p = 0 . 0073 ) .
Mean number of overall hypoglycaemic events with basal - bolus and premix was 13 . 99 and 18 . 54 events / patient year , respectively ( difference : - 3 . 90 ; 95 % CI : - 10 . 40 , 2 . 60 ; p = 0 . 2385 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : An intensified basal - bolus regimen using glargine / glulisine results in a significantly superior glycaemic control vs . premix therapy in a population with long - standing insulin - treated T2D , with no increase in the rates of hypoglycaemia .

AIM : To evaluate the effects of canagliflozin on plasma volume , urinary glucose excretion ( UGE ) , fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and additional measures of fluid / electrolyte balance in patients with type 2 diabetes on background therapy with metformin and angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers .
METHODS : Patients ( N = 36 ) were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive canagliflozin 300 mg or placebo for 12 weeks .
Pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed at baseline and at weeks 1 and 12 .
RESULTS : Increased 24 - h UGE was seen in the canagliflozin group compared with a reduction in the placebo group at both week 1 ( 91 . 8 vs . - 2 . 4 g ) and week 12 ( 82 . 6 vs . - 0 . 4 g ) .
Canagliflozin also reduced both FPG and HbA1c .
Reductions in body weight and blood pressure were observed at weeks 1 and 12 .
Canagliflozin decreased plasma volume compared with an increase with placebo at week 1 ( - 5 . 4 vs . 4 . 3 % ; p = 0 . 02 ) , but this was largely attenuated at week 12 ( 4 . 6 vs . 5 . 8 % ; p = 0 . 76 ) .
A modest numerical increase in urine volume was observed with canagliflozin at week 1 that was attenuated at week 12 ; other measures of volume status ( i . e .
blood urea nitrogen , serum creatinine and haematocrit ) remained modestly increased with canagliflozin at week 12 .
CONCLUSION : Canagliflozin provided sustained effects on UGE and FPG over 12 weeks and a transient reduction in plasma volume that was largely attenuated by week 12 .

OBJECTIVE : The efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitor , sitagliptin , added to ongoing metformin therapy , were assessed in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control ( HbA ( 1c ) [ A1C ] > or = 7 and < or = 10 % ) with metformin alone .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : After a screening diet / exercise run - in period , a metformin dose titration / stabilization period , and a 2 - week , single - blind , placebo run - in period , 701 patients , aged 19 - 78 years , with mild to moderate hyperglycemia ( mean A1C 8 . 0 % ) receiving ongoing metformin ( > or = 1 , 500 mg / day ) were randomly assigned to receive the addition of placebo or sitagliptin 100 mg once - daily in a 1 : 2 ratio for 24 weeks .
Patients exceeding specific glycemic limits were provided rescue therapy ( pioglitazone ) until the end of the study .
The efficacy analyses were based on an all - patients - treated population using an ANCOVA and excluded data obtained after glycemic rescue .
RESULTS : At week 24 , sitagliptin treatment led to significant reductions compared with placebo in A1C ( - 0 . 65 % ) , fasting plasma glucose , and 2 - h postmeal glucose .
Fasting insulin , fasting C - peptide , fasting proinsulin - to - insulin ratio , postmeal insulin and C - peptide areas under the curve ( AUCs ) , postmeal insulin AUC - to - glucose AUC ratio , homeostasis model assessment of beta - cell function , and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index were significantly improved with sitagliptin relative to placebo .
A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved an A1C < 7 % with sitagliptin ( 47 . 0 % ) than with placebo ( 18 . 3 % ) .
There was no increased risk of hypoglycemia or gastrointestinal adverse experiences with sitagliptin compared with placebo .
Body weight decreased similarly with sitagliptin and placebo .
CONCLUSIONS : Sitagliptin 100 mg once - daily added to ongoing metformin therapy was efficacious and well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control with metformin alone .

AIMS : To investigate the efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitor linagliptin in patients with Type  2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by a combination of metformin and pioglitazone .
METHODS : This was a multi - centre , phase  3 , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study comparing linagliptin 5  mg once daily ( n = 183 ) and placebo ( n = 89 ) as add - on to metformin and pioglitazone .
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) after 24  weeks .
RESULTS : The placebo - corrected adjusted mean ( se ) change in HbA1c from baseline to 24  weeks was - 6 ( 1 ) mmol / mol [ - 0 . 57 ( 0 . 13 ) % ] ( P < 0 . 0001 ) .
In patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 53  mmol / mol ( 7 . 0 % ) , 32 . 4 % of patients in the linagliptin group and 13 . 8 % in the placebo group achieved HbA1c < 53  mmol / mol ( 7 . 0 % ) ( odds ratio  2 . 94 ; P = 0 . 0033 ) .
The placebo - corrected adjusted mean ( se ) change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose at week  24 was - 0 . 57 ( 0 . 26 ) mmol / l [ - 10 . 4 ( 4 . 7 ) mg / dl ] ( P = 0 . 0280 ) .
The incidence of serious adverse events was 2 . 2 % with linagliptin and 3 . 4 % with placebo .
Investigator - defined hypoglycaemia occurred in 5 . 5 % of the linagliptin group and 5 . 6 % of the placebo group .
No meaningful changes in mean body weight were noted for either group .
CONCLUSIONS : Linagliptin as add - on therapy to metformin and pioglitazone produced significant and clinically meaningful improvements in glycaemic control , without an additional risk of hypoglycaemia or weight gain ( Clinical Trials Registry No : NCT 00996658 ) .

OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the safety and efficacy of methazolamide as a potential therapy for type 2 diabetes .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : This double - blind , placebo - controlled study randomized 76 patients to oral methazolamide ( 40 mg b . i . d . )
or placebo for 24 weeks .
The primary efficacy end point for methazolamide treatment was a placebo - corrected reduction in HbA1c from baseline after 24 weeks ( Δ HbA1c ) .
RESULTS : Mean ± SD baseline HbA1c was 7 . 1 ± 0 . 7 % ( 54 ± 5 mmol / mol ; n = 37 ) and 7 . 4 ± 0 . 6 % ( 57 ± 5 mmol / mol ; n = 39 ) in the methazolamide and placebo groups , respectively .
Methazolamide treatment was associated with a Δ HbA1c of - 0 . 39 % ( 95 % CI - 0 . 82 , 0 . 04 ; P < 0 . 05 ) ( - 4 . 3 mmol / mol [ - 9 . 0 , 0 . 4 ] ) , an increase in the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c ≤ 6 . 5 % ( 48 mmol / mol ) from 8 to 33 % , a rapid reduction in alanine aminotransferase ( ∼ 10 units / L ) , and weight loss ( 2 % ) in metformin - cotreated patients .
CONCLUSIONS : Methazolamide is the archetype for a new intervention in type 2 diabetes with clinical benefits beyond glucose control .

Colesevelam has shown efficacy in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) in combination with metformin - , sulfonylurea - , or insulin - based therapy , lowering hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) and low - density lipoprotein cholesterol levels .
A study was conducted to evaluate colesevelam as monotherapy in drug - na ï ve patients with T2DM .
In this randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel - group study , adults with T2DM who had inadequate glycemic control ( HbA1c ≥ 7 . 5 % and ≤ 9 . 5 % ) with diet and exercise alone were randomized to receive colesevelam 3 . 75  g / day ( n = 176 ) or placebo ( n = 181 ) for 24 weeks .
The primary efficacy variable was HbA1c at week 24 .
Colesevelam as compared to placebo showed significant reductions from baseline in HbA1c ( - 2 . 92  mmol / mol [ 0 . 3 % ] ; p = 0 . 01 ) and fasting plasma glucose ( - 10 . 3  mg / dl ; p = 0 . 04 ) at week 24 with last observation carried forward .
Colesevelam also significantly reduced low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( - 11 . 2 % ; p < 0 . 0001 ) , total cholesterol ( - 5 . 1 % ; p = 0 . 0005 ) , non - high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( - 7 . 4 % ; p = 0 . 0001 ) , and apolipoprotein B ( - 6 . 5 % ; p = 0 . 0001 ) and increased apolipoprotein A - I ( + 2 . 4 % ; p = 0 . 04 ) , and triglycerides ( + 9 . 7 % ; p = 0 . 03 ) .
Colesevelam monotherapy resulted in statistically significant improvements in glycemic and most lipid parameters in subjects with type 2 diabetes , with no new or unexpected safety and tolerability issues .
Modest reductions in HbA1c and low - density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with colesevelam further support its use in combination with other antidiabetes agents when treatment targets for these parameters are close but are not quite achieved . ClinicalTrials . gov identifier : NCT00789737 .

Bo . Ahren @ med . lu . se The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of insulin processing to the improved meal - related B - cell function previously shown with the DPP - 4 inhibitor vildagliptin .
Fifty - five patients with type 2 diabetes ( 56 . 5 + / - 1 . 5 years ; BMI = 29 . 6 + / - 0 . 5 kg / m ( 2 ) ; FPG = 9 . 9 + / - 0 . 2 mmol / l ; HbA1c = 7 . 7 + / - 0 . 1 % ) were studied : 29 patients were treated with vildagliptin and 26 patients with placebo , both added to an ongoing metformin regimen ( 1 . 5 - 3 . 0 g / day ) .
A standardized breakfast was given at baseline and after 52 weeks of treatment , and proinsulin related to insulin secretion was measured with C - peptide in the fasting and postprandial ( over 4 h post - meal ) states to evaluate B - cell function .
The between - treatment difference ( vildagliptin - placebo ) in mean change from baseline in fasting proinsulin to C - peptide ratio ( fastP / C ) was - 0 . 007 + / - 0 . 009 ( p = 0 . 052 ) .
Following the standard breakfast , 52 weeks of treatment with vildagliptin significantly decreased the dynamic proinsulin to C - peptide ratio ( dynP / C ) relative to placebo by 0 . 010 + / - 0 . 008 ( p = 0 . 037 ) .
Importantly , when the P / C was expressed in relation to the glucose stimulus ( i . e . , the fasting glucose and glucose AUC ( 0 - 240 min ) , respectively ) , the P / C relative to glucose was significantly reduced with vildagliptin vs . placebo , both in the fasting state ( p = 0 . 023 ) and postprandially ( p = 0 . 004 ) .
In conclusion , a more efficient B - cell insulin processing provides further evidence that vildagliptin treatment ameliorates abnormal B - cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes .

BACKGROUND :  The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy , safety and tolerability of sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin therapy in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) who failed to achieve adequate glycemic control with metformin monotherapy .
METHODS :  After a metformin titration / stabilization period and a 2 - week , single - blind , placebo run - in period , 395 Chinese patients with T2DM aged 25 - 77 years ( baseline HbA1c 8 . 5 % ) were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to double - blind placebo or sitagliptin 100 mg q . d .
added to ongoing open - label metformin ( 1000 or 1700 mg / day ) for 24 weeks .
RESULTS :  Significant ( P < 0 . 001 ) changes from baseline in HbA1c ( - 0 . 9 % ) , fasting plasma glucose ( - 1 . 2 mmol / L ) , and 2 - h post - meal plasma glucose ( - 1 . 9 mmol / L ) were seen with sitagliptin compared with placebo .
There were no significant differences between sitagliptin and placebo in the incidence of hypoglycemia or gastrointestinal adverse events .
A small decrease from baseline body weight was observed in the placebo group compared with no change in the sitagliptin group ( between - group difference 0 . 5kg ; P = 0 . 018 ) .
CONCLUSIONS :  The addition of sitagliptin 100 mg to ongoing metformin therapy significantly improved glycemic control and was generally well tolerated in Chinese patients with T2DM who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin alone .

AIMS / HYPOTHESIS : The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of once - weekly albiglutide with once - daily insulin glargine ( A21Gly , B31Arg , B32Arg human insulin ) in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin with or without sulfonylurea .
METHODS : This was a randomised , open - label , multicentre ( n = 222 ) , parallel - group , non - inferiority out - patient clinical trial , with 779 patients enrolled in the study .
The study was conducted in 222 centres located in four countries .
Patients aged ≥ 18 years with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin ( ± sulfonylurea ) for at least 3 months with a baseline HbA1c 7 . 0 - 10 . 0 % ( 53 . 0 - 85 . 8 mmol / mol ) were randomly assigned ( 2 : 1 ) via a computer - generated randomisation sequence with a voice response system to receive albiglutide ( 30 mg once a week , n = 504 ) or insulin glargine ( 10 U once a day , n = 241 ) added to current therapy .
Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment .
Doses of each medication were adjusted on the basis of the glycaemic response .
The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 52 .
RESULTS : In the albiglutide group , HbA1c declined from 8 . 28 ± 0 . 90 % ( 67 . 0 ± 9 . 8 mmol / mol ) ( mean ± SD ) at baseline to 7 . 62 ± 1 . 12 % ( 59 . 8 ± 12 . 2 mmol / mol ) at week 52 .
A similar reduction occurred in the insulin glargine group ( 8 . 36 ± 0 . 95 % to 7 . 55 ± 1 . 04 % [ 67 . 9 ± 10 . 4 to 59 . 0 ± 11 . 4 mmol / mol ] ) .
The model - adjusted treatment difference of 0 . 11 % ( 95 % CI - 0 . 04 % , 0 . 27 % ) ( 1 . 2 mmol / mol [ 95 % CI - 0 . 4 , 3 . 0 mmol / mol ] ) indicated non - inferiority of albiglutide to insulin glargine based on the pre - specified non - inferiority margin of 0 . 3 % ( 3 . 3 mmol / mol , p = 0 . 0086 ) .
Body weight increased in the insulin glargine group and decreased in the albiglutide group , with a mean treatment difference of - 2 . 61 kg ( 95 % CI - 3 . 20 , - 2 . 02 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .
Documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in a higher proportion of patients in the insulin glargine group than in the albiglutide group ( 27 . 4 % vs 17 . 5 % , p = 0 . 0377 ) .
CONCLUSIONS / INTERPRETATION : Albiglutide was non - inferior to insulin glargine at reducing HbA1c at week 52 , with modest weight loss and less hypoglycaemia .
Both drugs were well tolerated .
Albiglutide may be considered an alternative to insulin glargine in this patient population .

We designed an experiment to examine the effect of bile acid sequestration with Colesevelam on fasting and postprandial glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes .
To do so , we tested the hypothesis that Colesevelam increases the disposition index ( DI ) , and this increase is associated with increased glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( GLP - 1 ) concentrations .
Thirty - eight subjects on metformin monotherapy were studied using a double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel - group design .
Subjects were studied before and after 12 weeks of Colesevelam or placebo using a labeled triple - tracer mixed meal to measure the rate of meal appearance ( Meal Ra ) , endogenous glucose production ( EGP ) , and glucose disappearance ( Rd ) .
Insulin sensitivity and β- cell responsivity indices were estimated using the oral minimal model and then used to calculate DI .
Therapy with Colesevelam was associated with a decrease in fasting ( 7 . 0 ± 0 . 2 vs . 6 . 6 ± 0 . 2 mmol / L ; P = 0 . 004 ) and postprandial glucose concentrations ( 3 , 145 ± 138 vs . 2 , 896 ± 127 mmol / 6 h ; P = 0 . 01 ) in the absence of a change in insulin concentrations .
Minimal model - derived indices of insulin secretion and action were unchanged .
Postprandial GLP - 1 concentrations were not altered by Colesevelam .
Although EGP and Rd were unchanged , integrated Meal Ra was decreased by Colesevelam ( 5 , 191 ± 204 vs . 5 , 817 ± 204 μ mol / kg / 6 h ; P = 0 . 04 ) , suggesting increased splanchnic sequestration of meal - derived glucose .

OBJECTIVE : To compare the efficacy and safety of once - weekly semaglutide 1 . 0 mg s . c . with exenatide extended release ( ER ) 2 . 0 mg s . c . in subjects with type 2 diabetes .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : In this phase 3a , open - label , parallel - group , randomized controlled trial , 813 subjects with type 2 diabetes taking oral antidiabetic drugs were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to semaglutide 1 . 0 mg or exenatide ER 2 . 0 mg for 56 weeks .
The primary end point was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 56 .
RESULTS : Mean HbA1c ( 8 . 3 % [ 67 . 7 mmol / mol ] at baseline ) was reduced by 1 . 5 % ( 16 . 8 mmol / mol ) with semaglutide and 0 . 9 % ( 10 . 0 mmol / mol ) with exenatide ER ( estimated treatment difference vs . exenatide ER [ ETD ] - 0 . 62 % [ 95 % CI - 0 . 80 , - 0 . 44 ] [ - 6 . 78 mmol / mol ( 95 % CI - 8 . 70 , - 4 . 86 ) ] ; P < 0 . 0001 for noninferiority and superiority ) .
Mean body weight ( 95 . 8 kg at baseline ) was reduced by 5 . 6 kg with semaglutide and 1 . 9 kg with exenatide ER ( ETD - 3 . 78 kg [ 95 % CI - 4 . 58 , - 2 . 98 ] ; P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Significantly more subjects treated with semaglutide ( 67 % ) achieved HbA1c < 7 . 0 % ( < 53 mmol / mol ) versus those taking exenatide ER ( 40 % ) .
Both treatments had similar safety profiles , but gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in semaglutide - treated subjects ( 41 . 8 % ) than in exenatide ER - treated subjects ( 33 . 3 % ) ; injection - site reactions were more frequent with exenatide ER ( 22 . 0 % ) than with semaglutide ( 1 . 2 % ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Semaglutide 1 . 0 mg was superior to exenatide ER 2 . 0 mg in improving glycemic control and reducing body weight after 56 weeks of treatment ; the drugs had comparable safety profiles .
These results indicate that semaglutide treatment is highly effective for subjects with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drugs .

INTRODUCTION : We evaluated the tolerability and efficacy of the addition of sitagliptin in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving stable insulin therapy alone or in combination with metformin .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : A total of 467 patients with inadequate glycemic control on insulin ( glycated hemoglobin [ HbA1c ] ≥ 7 . 5 % and ≤ 11 % ) were randomized 1 : 1 to receive sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or a matching placebo for 24 weeks .
Randomization was stratified based on metformin use ( on or not on metformin ) and type of insulin ( pre - mixed vs intermediate - / long - acting ) at screening .
The primary end - point was the change from baseline at week 24 in HbA1c .
RESULTS : The addition of sitagliptin led to a significantly ( P < 0 . 001 ) greater week 24 HbA1c reduction ( 0 . 7 % ) compared with the reduction ( 0 . 3 % ) with placebo .
A significantly ( P = 0 . 013 ) greater proportion of patients taking sitagliptin ( 16 % ) had an HbA1c of < 7 . 0 % at week 24 compared with placebo ( 8 % ) .
The addition of sitagliptin significantly ( P < 0 . 001 ) reduced 2 - h post - meal glucose by 26 . 5 mg / dL ( 1 . 5 mmol / L ) relative to placebo .
Reductions from baseline in fasting plasma glucose were observed in both the sitagliptin ( 14 . 4 mg / dL reduction ) and placebo ( 10 . 7 mg / dL reduction ) groups ; the between - group difference was not significant .
A total of 64 ( 27 . 4 % ) patients taking sitagliptin and 51 ( 21 . 9 % ) taking placebo experienced adverse events of hypoglycemia ( symptomatic or asymptomatic ) .
Neither group had a significant change from baseline in bodyweight .
CONCLUSIONS : After 24 weeks , sitagliptin added to stable insulin therapy ( ± metformin ) was generally well tolerated and improved glycemic control in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .

BACKGROUND : The prevalence of type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) in youth is increasing .
Treatment options beyond metformin and insulin are needed .
The safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of liraglutide once daily in youth ( 10 - 17 years old ) with T2D were investigated in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial .
SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Youth treated with diet / exercise alone or with metformin and having a hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) level of 6 . 5 - 11 % were randomized to liraglutide ( n = 14 ) or placebo ( n = 7 ) .
Starting at 0 . 3 mg / day , doses were escalated weekly to 0 . 6 , 0 . 9 , 1 . 2 , and 1 . 8 mg / day ( or placebo equivalent ) for 5 weeks .
RESULTS : Nineteen participants completed the trial .
Baseline characteristics were similar between groups , with mean ( SD ) values for age of 14 . 8 ( 2 . 2 ) years , weight of 113 . 2 ( 35 . 6 ) kg ( range , 57 - 214 kg ) , diabetes duration of 1 . 7 ( 1 . 4 ) years , and HbA1c level of 8 . 1 % ( 1 . 2 % ) .
No serious adverse events ( AEs ) , including severe hypoglycemia , occurred .
Transient gastrointestinal AEs were most common at lower liraglutide doses during dose escalation .
No significant changes in safety and tolerability parameters occurred .
There was no evidence of pancreatitis or lipase elevations above three times the upper normal limit ; calcitonin levels remained within the normal range .
For liraglutide 1 . 8 mg , mean half - life was 12 h , and clearance was 1 . 7 L / h .
After 5 weeks , the decline in HbA1c level was greater with liraglutide versus placebo ( - 0 . 86 vs . 0 . 04 % , P = 0 . 0007 ) , whereas mean body weight remained stable ( - 0 . 50 vs . - 0 . 54 kg , P = 0 . 9703 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Liraglutide was well tolerated in youth with T2D , with safety , tolerability , and pharmacokinetic profiles similar to profiles in adults .

OBJECTIVE : Safety and efficacy of biphasic insulin aspart 70 / 30 ( BIAsp 70 / 30 , prebreakfast and presupper ) were compared with once - daily insulin glargine in type 2 diabetic subjects inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drugs ( OADs ) .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : This 28 - week parallel - group study randomized 233 insulin - naive patients with HbA ( 1c ) values > / = 8 . 0 % on > 1 , 000 mg / day metformin alone or in combination with other OADs .
Metformin was adjusted up to 2 , 550 mg / day before insulin therapy was initiated with 5 - 6 units BIAsp 70 / 30 twice daily or 10 - 12 units glargine at bedtime and titrated to target blood glucose ( 80 - 110 mg / dl ) by algorithm - directed titration .
RESULTS : A total of 209 subjects completed the study .
At study end , the mean HbA ( 1c ) value was lower in the BIAsp 70 / 30 group than in the glargine group ( 6 . 91 + / - 1 . 17 vs . 7 . 41 + / - 1 . 24 % , P < 0 . 01 ) .
The HbA ( 1c ) reduction was greater in the BIAsp 70 / 30 group than in the glargine group ( - 2 . 79 + / - 0 . 11 vs . - 2 . 36 + / - 0 . 11 % , respectively ; P < 0 . 01 ) , especially for subjects with baseline HbA ( 1c ) > 8 . 5 % ( - 3 . 13 + / - 1 . 63 vs . - 2 . 60 + / - 1 . 50 % , respectively ; P < 0 . 05 ) .
More BIAsp 70 / 30 - treated subjects reached target HbA ( 1c ) values than glargine - treated subjects ( HbA ( 1c ) < / = 6 . 5 % : 42 vs . 28 % , P < 0 . 05 ; HbA ( 1c ) < 7 . 0 % : 66 vs . 40 % , P < 0 . 001 ) .
Minor hypoglycemia ( episodes / year ) was greater in the BIAsp 70 / 30 group than in the glargine group ( 3 . 4 + / - 6 . 6 and 0 . 7 + / - 2 . 0 , respectively ; P < 0 . 05 ) .
Weight gain and daily insulin dose at study end were greater for BIAsp 70 / 30 - treated subjects than for glargine - treated subjects ( weight gain : 5 . 4 + / - 4 . 8 vs . 3 . 5 + / - 4 . 5 kg , P < 0 . 01 ; insulin dose : 78 . 5 + / - 39 . 5 and 51 . 3 + / - 26 . 7 units / day , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS : In subjects with type 2 diabetes poorly controlled on OADs , initiating insulin therapy with twice - daily BIAsp 70 / 30 was more effective in achieving HbA ( 1c ) targets than once - daily glargine , especially in subjects with HbA ( 1c ) > 8 . 5 % .

KSTROJEK @ sum . edu . pl OBJECTIVES : To assess the efficacy and safety of biphasic insulin aspart 70 / 30 ( BIAsp 30 ) and insulin glargine , administered once daily in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with oral anti - diabetic drugs .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : In this 26 - week , open - labeled , randomized , parallel - group , multinational , treat - to - target trial , 480 insulin - na ï ve subjects were randomized to receive either BIAsp 30 before dinner or insulin glargine at bedtime , both in combination with metformin and glimepiride .
TRIAL REGISTRATION : NCT00469092 , ClinicalTrials . gov .
RESULTS : A total of 433 subjects completed the trial .
Estimated mean reduction in HbA ( 1c ) from baseline to end of treatment was - 1 . 41 % with BIAsp 30 and - 1 . 25 % with insulin glargine ( BIAsp 30 - insulin glargine = - 0 . 16 % , 95 % CI [ - 0 . 30 ; - 0 . 02 ] , p = 0 . 029 ) .
At the end of treatment , mean HbA ( 1c ) was 7 . 1 % and 7 . 3 % for BIAsp 30 and insulin glargine , respectively .
Significantly lower plasma glucose levels were observed with BIAsp 30 post - dinner ( BIAsp 30 - insulin glargine = - 0 . 52 mmol / L , 95 % CI [ - 1 . 02 ; - 0 . 03 ] , p = 0 . 04 ) and at bedtime ( BIAsp 30 - insulin glargine = - 0 . 78 mmol / L , 95 % CI [ - 1 . 25 ; - 0 . 31 ] , p < 0 . 01 ) .
The relative risk ( RR ) of experiencing a nocturnal hypoglycemic episode ( 00 : 00 - 06 . 00 a . m . ) was significantly higher with BIAsp 30 than with insulin glargine ( 1 . 1 versus 0 . 5 episodes / year , RR = 2 . 41 , 95 % CI [ 1 . 34 ; 4 . 34 ] , p = 0 . 003 ) , but overall hypoglycemia rates were low .
There were three major hypoglycemic episodes in each group .
CONCLUSIONS : With respect to HbA ( 1c ) , BIAsp 30 fulfilled the statistical criteria for non - inferiority and superiority to insulin glargine and , according to pre - defined criteria , the improvements in HbA ( 1c ) are considered clinically equivalent .
Subjects had an increased risk of minor nocturnal hypoglycemia with BIAsp 30 .
There were no differences in treatment satisfaction between the two groups .

AIMS : To assess efficacy and safety of sitagliptin , a dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitor , in combination therapy with metformin ( ≥ 1500 mg / day ) and pioglitazone ( ≥ 30 mg / day ) in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) with inadequate glycemic control ( hemoglobin A1c [ HbA1c ] ≥ 7 . 5 % and ≤ 11 % ) .
METHODS : This placebo - controlled , double - blind study included 313 patients , mean baseline HbA1c = 8 . 7 % , who were randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg / day or placebo for 26 weeks .
RESULTS : The addition of sitagliptin led to significant ( P < . 001 ) mean changes from baseline relative to placebo in HbA1c ( - 0 . 7 % ) , fasting plasma glucose ( - 1 . 0 mmol / L ) , and 2 - h post - meal glucose ( - 2 . 2 mmol / L ) .
In patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 9 . 0 % , mean changes from baseline in HbA1c were - 1 . 6 % and - 0 . 8 % for the sitagliptin and placebo groups , respectively ( between - group difference - 0 . 8 % ; P < . 001 ) .
The incidences of reported adverse events were generally similar between the treatment groups .
Incidences of symptomatic hypoglycemia were 7 / 157 [ 4 . 5 % ] and 6 / 156 [ 3 . 8 % ] in the sitagliptin and placebo groups , respectively ( P = . 786 ) .
Two patients , both in the placebo group , experienced an episode of hypoglycemia that required non - medical assistance .
CONCLUSIONS : In this 26 - week study , addition of sitagliptin to combination therapy with metformin and pioglitazone improved glycemic control and was generally well tolerated .

AIM : To compare the efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitor sitagliptin with the sodium - glucose transporter - 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild renal insufficiency .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Patients with HbA1c ≥ 7 . 0 to ≤ 9 . 5 % ( ≥ 53 to ≤ 80  mmol / mol ) and estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 to < 90  mL / min / 1 . 73m2 on metformin ( ≥ 1500  mg / d ) ± sulfonylurea were randomized to sitagliptin 100  mg ( n = 307 ) or dapagliflozin 5 mg titrated to 10 mg ( n = 306 ) once daily for 24  weeks .
A longitudinal data analysis model was used to test the primary hypothesis that sitagliptin is non - inferior to dapagliflozin in reducing HbA1c at Week 24 , with superiority to be tested if non - inferiority is met .
ClinicalTrials . gov NCT02532855 .
RESULTS : Baseline mean HbA1c ( % [ mmol / mol ] ) was 7 . 7 ( 60 . 9 ) and 7 . 8 ( 61 . 2 ) , and mean eGFR ( mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) was 79 . 4 and 76 . 9 for the sitagliptin and dapagliflozin groups , respectively .
After 24  weeks , the between - group difference in least squares mean ( 95 % CI ) changes from baseline in HbA1c was - 0 . 15 % ( - 0 . 26 , - 0 . 04 ) ( - 1 . 67  mmol / mol [ - 2 . 86 , - 0 . 48 ] ) , P = 0 . 006 , meeting the prespecified criteria for declaring both non - inferiority and superiority of sitagliptin versus dapagliflozin .
The HbA1c goal of < 7 % ( < 53  mmol / mol ) was met by 43 % ( sitagliptin ) and 27 % ( dapagliflozin ) of patients .
No meaningful between - group difference was observed in a pre - specified analysis of 2 - hour incremental postprandial glucose excursion .
A review of adverse events ( AEs ) was notable for a lower incidence of drug - related AEs with sitagliptin compared with dapagliflozin .
CONCLUSIONS : In patients with type 2 diabetes , mild renal insufficiency and inadequate glycaemic control on metformin ± sulfonylurea , sitagliptin treatment resulted in greater improvement in glycaemic control compared with dapagliflozin and was generally well tolerated .

AIMS : To examine the efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitor linagliptin in persons with Type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled [ HbA ( 1c ) 53 - 86 mmol / mol ( 7 . 0 - 10 . 0 % ) ] by metformin and sulphonylurea combination treatment .
METHODS : A multi - centre , 24 - week , randomized , double - blind , parallel - group study in 1058 patients comparing linagliptin ( 5 mg once daily ) and placebo when added to metformin plus sulphonylurea .
The primary endpoint was the change in HbA ( 1c ) after 24 weeks .
RESULTS : At week 24 , the linagliptin placebo - corrected HbA ( 1c ) adjusted mean change from baseline was - 7 mmol / mol ( - 0 . 62 % ) [ 95 % CI - 8 to - 6 mmol / mol ( - 0 . 73 to - 0 . 50 % ) ; P < 0 . 0001 ] .
More participants with baseline HbA ( 1c ) ≥ 53 mmol / mol ( ≥ 7 . 0 % ) achieved an HbA ( 1c ) < 53 mmol / mol ( < 7 . 0 % ) with linagliptin compared with placebo ( 29 . 2 % vs . 8 . 1 % , P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Fasting plasma glucose was reduced with linagliptin relative to placebo ( - 0 . 7 mmol / l , 95 % CI - 1 . 0 to - 0 . 4 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Improvements in homeostasis model assessment of β- cell function were seen with linagliptin ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
The proportion of patients who reported a severe adverse event was low in both groups ( linagliptin 2 . 4 % ; placebo 1 . 5 % ) .
Symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurred in 16 . 7 and 10 . 3 % of the linagliptin and placebo groups , respectively .
Hypoglycaemia was generally mild or moderate ; severe hypoglycaemia was reported in 2 . 7 and 4 . 8 % of the participants experiencing hypoglycaemic episodes in the linagliptin and placebo groups , respectively .
No significant weight changes were noted .
CONCLUSIONS : In patients with Type 2 diabetes , adding linagliptin to metformin given in combination with a sulphonylurea significantly improved glycaemic control and this was well tolerated .
Linagliptin could provide a valuable treatment option for individuals with inadequate glycaemic control despite ongoing combination therapy with metformin and a sulphonylurea .

BACKGROUND : Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is a progressive disease that often requires a patient to use multiple antihyperglycemic agents to achieve glycemic control with disease progression .
Omarigliptin is a once - weekly dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitor .
The purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of adding omarigliptin to the treatment regimen of patients with T2D inadequately controlled by dual therapy with metformin and glimepiride .
METHODS : Patients with T2D and HbA1c ≥ 7 . 5 % and ≤ 10 . 5 % while on metformin ( ≥ 1500  mg / day ) and glimepiride ( ≥ 4  mg / day ) were randomized to omarigliptin 25  mg once - weekly ( N = 154 ) or placebo ( N = 153 ) for 24  weeks .
The primary objective was to assess whether omarigliptin was superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c at Week 24 .
Secondary objectives were to assess the effects of omarigliptin vs . placebo on FPG and the proportion of subjects attaining HbA1c goals of < 7 % and < 6 . 5 % .
RESULTS : From a mean baseline HbA1c of 8 . 5 % ( omarigliptin ) and 8 . 6 % ( placebo ) , the least squares ( LS ) mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 was - 0 . 67 % in the omarigliptin group and - 0 . 06 % in the placebo group , with a between - group difference ( 95 % CI ) of - 0 . 61 % ( - 0 . 85 , - 0 . 38 ) .
Treatment with omarigliptin resulted in a significantly greater reduction in FPG relative to placebo ( LS mean difference [ 95 % CI ] - 0 . 9  mmol / L [ - 1 . 4 , - 0 . 4 ] ; p < 0 . 001 ) .
The proportion of patients achieving glycemic goals of < 7 . 0 % and < 6 . 5 % was higher in the omarigliptin group relative to the placebo group .
The overall incidences of adverse events ( AEs ) , serious AEs , drug - related AEs and discontinuations were generally similar between treatment groups .
The incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia was 10 . 5 % in the omarigliptin group and 8 . 5 % in the placebo group .
Relative to baseline , omarigliptin and placebo treatments were associated with LS mean changes in body weight of - 0 . 1  kg and - 0 . 9  kg , respectively .
CONCLUSION : In patients with T2D and inadequate glycemic control on dual therapy with metformin and glimepiride , compared with placebo , once - weekly omarigliptin provided greater improvement in glycemic control and was generally well tolerated .

AIM : The broadly used combination of metformin and sulphonylurea ( SU ) often fails to bring patients to glycaemic goal .
This study assessed the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin as add - on therapy to metformin plus glimepiride combination in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) who had inadequate glycaemic control .
METHODS : A multicentre , double - blind , placebo - controlled study randomized patients to receive treatment with vildagliptin 50  mg bid ( n = 158 ) or placebo ( n = 160 ) for 24  weeks .
RESULTS : After 24  weeks , the adjusted mean change in haemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) was - 1 . 01 % with vildagliptin ( baseline 8 . 75 % ) and - 0 . 25 % with placebo ( baseline 8 . 80 % ) , with a between - treatment difference of - 0 . 76 % ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
Significantly more patients on vildagliptin achieved the HbA1c target < 7 % ( 28 . 3 % vs . 5 . 6 % ; p < 0 . 001 ) .
The difference in fasting plasma glucose reduction between vildagliptin and placebo was - 1 . 13  mmol / l ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
In subgroup of patients with baseline HbA1c ≤ 8 % , vildagliptin reduced HbA1c by 0 . 74 % from baseline 7 . 82 % ( between - treatment difference : - 0 . 97 % ; p < 0 . 001 ) with significantly more patients achieving the HbA1c target < 7 % ( 38 . 6 % vs . 13 . 9 % ; p = 0 . 014 ) .
Vildagliptin was well tolerated with low incidence of hypoglycaemia , slightly higher than with placebo ( 5 . 1 % vs . 1 . 9 % ) and no clinically relevant weight gain .
CONCLUSIONS : Vildagliptin significantly improved glycaemic control in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin plus glimepiride combination .
The addition of vildagliptin was well tolerated with low risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain .
This makes vildagliptin an attractive treatment option for patients failing on metformin plus SU particularly in patients with baseline HbA1c ≤ 8 % .
