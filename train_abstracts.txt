OBJECTIVE : The efficacy and tolerability of the dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitor sitagliptin added to ongoing pioglitazone therapy were assessed in patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control ( glycosylated hemoglobin [ HbA ( 1c ) ] > or = 7 % and < or = 10 % ) while receiving a stable dose of pioglitazone .
METHODS : This was a 24 - week , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel group study in patients aged > or = 18 years ( ClinicalTrials .
gov NCT00086502 ) .
At screening , all patients began a diet / exercise program that continued throughout the study period .
Patients taking antihyperglycemic therapy other than pioglitazone underwent a washout of this therapy and entered an 8 - to 14 - week open - label pioglitazone dose - titration / stabilization period .
Patients with an HbA ( 1c ) > or = 7 % and < or = 10 % at the end of this period entered a 2 - week , single - blind , placebo run - in period ( total duration of run - in period , up to 21 weeks ) .
Patients who had been receiving pioglitazone monotherapy ( 30 or 45 mg / d ) and had an HbA ( 1c ) > or = 7 % and < or = 10 % entered the 2 - week , single - blind , placebo run - in period directly .
Thus , at the time of randomization , all patients were receiving ongoing pioglitazone ( 30 or 45 mg / d ) .
Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or placebo for 24 weeks .
The primary efficacy end point was the change from baseline in HbA ( 1c ) at week 24 .
Secondary efficacy end points included the change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , insulin , and proinsulin ; the Homeostasis Model Assessment beta - cell function and insulin - resistance indexes ; the proinsulin / insulin ratio ; the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index ; the percent changes from baseline in selected lipid parameters ; the proportion of patients meeting the American Diabetes Association HbA ( 1c ) , goal of < 7 . 0 % ; the proportion of patients requiring metformin rescue therapy ; and the time to the initiation of rescue therapy .
RESULTS : One hundred seventy - five patients were randomized to receive sitagliptin , and 178 were randomized to receive placebo .
The mean ( SD ) baseline HbAlc value was 8 . 1 % ( 0 . 8 ) in the sitagliptin group and 8 . 0 % ( 0 . 8 ) in the placebo group .
After 24 weeks , sitagliptin added to pioglitazone therapy was associated with significant reductions compared with placebo in HbA ( 1c ) ( between - treatment difference in least squares [ LS ] mean change from baseline .
- 0 . 70 % ; 95 % CI , - 0 . 85 to - 0 . 54 ; P < 0 . 001 ) and FPG ( - 17 . 7 mg / dL ; 95 % CI , - 24 . 3 to - 11 . 0 ; P < 0 . 001 ) .
Mean HbA ( 1c ) values at end point were 7 . 2 % ( 0 . 9 ) and 7 . 8 % ( 1 . 1 ) in the respective treatment groups , and the proportions of patients reaching a target HbA ( 1c ) of < 7 . 0 % were 45 . 4 % and 23 . 0 % ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
Significant reductions in fasting serum proinsulin levels and the proinsulin / insulin ratio were seen with sitagliptin treatment compared with placebo ( both , P < 0 . 01 ) .
Sitagliptin was generally well tolerated , with no increased risk of hypoglycemia compared with placebo ( 2 vs 0 patients , respectively ) .

OBJECTIVE : The two major classes of antidiabetic drugs , sulfonylureas and metformin , may differentially affect macrovascular complications and mortality in diabetic patients .
We compared the long - term effects of glipizide and metformin on the major cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetic patients who had a history of coronary artery disease ( CAD ) .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : This study is a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trial .
A total of 304 type 2 diabetic patients with CAD , mean age = 63 . 3 years ( range , 36 - 80 years ) , were enrolled .
Participants were randomly assigned to receive either glipizide ( 30 mg daily ) or metformin ( 1 . 5 g daily ) for 3 years .
The primary end points were times to the composite of recurrent cardiovascular events , including death from a cardiovascular cause , death from any cause , nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , or arterial revascularization .
RESULTS : At the end of study drug administration , both groups achieved a significant decrease in the level of glycated hemoglobin ( 7 . 1 % in the glipizide group and 7 . 0 % in the metformin group ) .
At a median follow - up of 5 . 0 years , 91 participants had developed 103 primary end points .
Intention - to - treat analysis showed an adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) of 0 . 54 ( 95 % CI 0 . 30 - 0 . 90 ; P = 0 . 026 ) for the composites of cardiovascular events among the patients that received metformin , compared with glipizide .
The secondary end points and adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS : Treatment with metformin for 3 years substantially reduced major cardiovascular events in a median follow - up of 5 . 0 years compared with glipizide .
Our results indicated a potential benefit of metformin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in high - risk patients .

The dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitors vildagliptin and sitagliptin are effective in treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Patients receiving standard doses of sitagliptin plus insulin may require increased doses of sitagliptin or switching to vildagliptin to improve blood glucose control .
This study compared the effects of increasing sitagliptin and switching to vildagliptin in type 2 diabetes patients receiving standard doses of sitagliptin plus insulin .
This prospective , randomized , parallel - group comparison trial enrolled 33 type 2 diabetes patients receiving 50 mg sitagliptin once daily plus insulin .
Seventeen patients were randomized to 50 mg vildagliptin twice daily , and 16 to 100 mg sitagliptin once daily , and evaluated by continuous glucose monitoring at baseline and after 8 weeks .
The primary end - point was the change in mean amplitude of glycemic excursions ( MAGE ) .
MAGE decreased from baseline in both the vildagliptin ( - 13 . 4 ± 35 . 7 mg / dL ) and sitagliptin ( - 8 . 4 ± 24 . 3 mg / dL ) groups , but neither within - nor between - group changes were statistically significant .
Similarly , the areas under the curve for blood glucose levels ≥ 180 mg / dL and < 70 mg / dL tended to improve in both groups , but these differences were not statistically significant .
In contrast , HbA1c was significantly reduced only in the vildagliptin group , from 7 . 1 ± 0 . 6 % at baseline to 6 . 8 ± 0 . 6 % at 8 weeks ( p = 0 . 006 ) .
Increasing sitagliptin dose and switching to vildagliptin had limited effects in improving MAGE in type 2 diabetic patients treated with standard doses of sitagliptin .

AIM : To assess the efficacy and safety of a 24 - week treatment with sitagliptin , a highly selective once - daily oral dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( DPP - 4 ) inhibitor , in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control [ glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA ( 1c ) ) > or = 7 . 5 % and < or = 10 . 5 % ] while on glimepiride alone or in combination with metformin .
METHODS : After a screening , diet / exercise run - in and drug wash - off period , a glimepiride + / - metformin dose titration / stabilization period and a 2 - week , single - blind placebo run - in , 441 patients ( of ages 18 - 75 years ) were randomized to receive the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or placebo in a 1 : 1 ratio for 24 weeks .
Of these patients , 212 were on glimepiride ( > or = 4 mg / day ) monotherapy and 229 were on glimepiride ( > or = 4 mg / day ) plus metformin ( > or = 1 , 500 mg / day ) combination therapy .
Patients exceeding pre - specified glycaemic thresholds during the double - blind treatment period were provided open - label rescue therapy ( pioglitazone ) until study end .
The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the change in HbA ( 1c ) from baseline to Week 24 .
Secondary efficacy endpoints included fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , 2 - h post - meal glucose and lipid measurements .
RESULTS : Mean baseline HbA ( 1c ) was 8 . 34 % in the sitagliptin and placebo groups .
After 24 weeks , sitagliptin reduced HbA ( 1c ) by 0 . 74 % ( p < 0 . 001 ) relative to placebo .
In the subset of patients on glimepiride plus metformin , sitagliptin reduced HbA ( 1c ) by 0 . 89 % relative to placebo , compared with a reduction of 0 . 57 % in the subset of patients on glimepiride alone .
The addition of sitagliptin reduced FPG by 20 . 1 mg / dl ( p < 0 . 001 ) and increased homeostasis model assessment - beta , a marker of beta - cell function , by 12 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) relative to placebo .
In patients who underwent a meal tolerance test ( n = 134 ) , sitagliptin decreased 2 - h post - prandial glucose ( PPG ) by 36 . 1 mg / dl ( p < 0 . 001 ) relative to placebo .
The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated , although there was a higher incidence of overall ( 60 vs . 47 % ) and drug - related adverse experiences ( AEs ) ( 15 vs . 7 % ) in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group .
This was largely because of a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia AEs ( 12 vs . 2 % , respectively ) in the sitagliptin group compared with the placebo group .
Body weight modestly increased with sitagliptin relative to placebo ( + 0 . 8 vs . - 0 . 4 kg ; p < 0 . 001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Sitagliptin 100 mg once daily significantly improved glycaemic control and beta - cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control with glimepiride or glimepiride plus metformin therapy .
The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated , with a modest increase in hypoglycaemia and body weight , consistent with glimepiride therapy and the observed degree of glycaemic improvement .

STUDY OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effect of acarbose on glycemic control and glycemic variability , using a continuous glucose - monitoring system , in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were not well controlled on metformin and vildagliptin therapy .
DESIGN : Multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study .
SETTING : Clinical research units at three hospitals in Italy .
PATIENTS : Fifty - three patients with type 2 diabetes who were taking stable dosages of metformin 850 mg 3 times / day and vildagliptin 50 mg twice / day for at least 3 months and who were not adequately controlled with these therapies .
INTERVENTION : Patients were randomized to either placebo or acarbose 100 mg 3 times / day to be added to their metformin - vildagliptin regimen .
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : Glycemic excursions were assessed by using a continuous glucose - monitoring system for 1 week .
Glycemic control was estimated as the mean blood glucose ( MBG ) level , the area under the glucose concentration - time curve for a glucose level above 70 mg / dl ( AUC above 70 ) or 180 mg / dl ( AUC above 180 ) , and the percentage of time that the glucose level was above 70 mg / dl ( T above 70 ) or 180 mg / dl ( T above 180 ) .
Intraday glycemic variability was assessed by the standard deviation of the blood glucose level , the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions ( MAGE ) , the M value , and continuous overlapping net glycemic action .
Day - to - day glycemic variability was assessed as the mean of daily difference ( MODD ) .
The MBG level was ~ 20 mg / dl lower in the acarbose group than in the placebo group ( p < 0 . 05 ) , particularly during the postprandial period .
The AUC above 70 did not significantly differ between the two groups , whereas the AUC above 180 was ~ 40 % lower in the acarbose group than in the placebo group during the daytime ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
The T above 180 was significantly higher in the placebo group than in the acarbose group ( 31 % vs 8 % , p < 0 . 01 .
Moreover , the standard deviation and MAGE values were significantly lower in the acarbose group .
The MODD value was not significantly changed in either group , and no significant differences were recorded between groups .
All adverse events were mild in both groups , with only a significantly greater frequency of flatulence noted in the acarbose group ( 5 % with acarbose vs 0 . 5 % with placebo , p < 0 . 05 ) .
CONCLUSION : The addition of acarbose to metformin and vildagliptin background therapy in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes decreased intraday glycemic variability , especially postprandial variability , but it was not associated with a significant change in interday glycemic variability .

massi @ unipg . it AIMS : The aim of the trial was to compare the efficacy and safety of the new , long - acting basal insulin , insulin glargine ( LANTUS ( R ) ) , with NPH human insulin , each administered in a combination regimen with oral antidiabetic drugs in patients with Type 2 diabetes .
METHODS : In a multicentre , open , randomised study , 570 patients with Type 2 diabetes , aged 34 - 80 years , were treated for 52 weeks with insulin glargine or NPH insulin given once daily at bedtime .
Previous oral antidiabetic therapy was continued throughout the study .
RESULTS : There was a clinically relevant decrease in glycosylated haemoglobin ( GHb ) values from baseline to endpoint with both drugs ( insulin glargine : - 0 . 46 % ; NPH insulin : - 0 . 38 % ; p = 0 . 415 ) ; also , this difference was statistically significant in the subgroup of overweight patients with BMI > 28 kg / m 2 ( insulin glargine : - 0 . 42 % , NPH insulin : - 0 . 11 % ; p = 0 . 0237 ) .
Over the entire treatment period , NPH insulin - treated patients ( 41 % ) and insulin glargine - treated patients ( 35 % ) experienced a similar level of symptomatic hypoglycaemia .
A statistically significant difference was observed in the number of patients treated with NPH insulin who reported at least one episode of nocturnal hypoglycaemia compared with those treated with insulin glargine in the overall population and in the overweight subgroup ( overall : 24 % vs . 12 % , p = 0 . 002 ; overweight : 22 . 2 % vs . 9 . 5 % , p = 0 . 0006 ) , using the Cochran - Mantel - Haenszel test .
These differences were most pronounced in insulin - na ï ve and overweight ( BMI > 28 kg / m 2 ) sub - groups .
The incidence of adverse events was similar for the two treatments .
CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrated that insulin glargine is as effective as NPH insulin in achieving glycaemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes , and is associated with fewer episodes of symptomatic hypoglycaemia , particularly nocturnal episodes .

BACKGROUND : We investigated whether metformin hydrochloride has sustained beneficial metabolic and ( cardio ) vascular effects in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM2 ) .
METHODS : We studied 390 patients treated with insulin in the outpatient clinics of 3 hospitals in a randomized , placebo - controlled trial with a follow - up period of 4 . 3 years .
Either metformin hydrochloride , 850 mg , or placebo ( 1 - 3 times daily ) was added to insulin therapy .
The primary end point was an aggregate of microvascular and macrovascular morbidity and mortality .
The secondary end points were microvascular and macrovascular morbidity and mortality , as separate aggregate scores .
In addition , effects on hemoglobin A ( 1c ) ( HbA ( 1c ) ) , insulin requirement , lipid levels , blood pressure , body weight , and body mass index were analyzed .
RESULTS : Metformin treatment prevented weight gain ( mean weight gain , - 3 . 07 kg [ range , - 3 . 85 to - 2 . 28 kg ] ; P < . 001 ) , improved glycemic control ( mean reduction in HbA ( 1c ) level , 0 . 4 % percentage point [ 95 % CI , 0 . 55 - 0 . 25 ] ; P < . 001 ) ( where CI indicates confidence interval ) , despite the aim of similar glycemic control in both groups , and reduced insulin requirements ( mean reduction , 19 . 63 IU / d [ 95 % CI , 24 . 91 - 14 . 36 IU / d ] ; P < . 001 ) .
Metformin was not associated with an improvement in the primary end point .
It was , however , associated with an improvement in the secondary , macrovascular end point ( hazard ratio , 0 . 61 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 40 - 0 . 94 ; P = . 02 ) , which was partly explained by the difference in weight .
The number needed to treat to prevent 1 macrovascular end point was 16 . 1 ( 95 % CI , 9 . 2 - 66 . 6 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Metformin , added to insulin in patients with DM2 , improved body weight , glycemic control , and insulin requirements but did not improve the primary end point .
Metformin did , however , reduce the risk of macrovascular disease after a follow - up period of 4 . 3 years .
These sustained beneficial effects support the policy to continue metformin treatment after the introduction of insulin in any patient with DM2 , unless contraindicated .

Summary for patients in Ann Intern Med .
2007 Apr 3 ; 146 ( 7 ) : I18 .
BACKGROUND : Exenatide therapy is effective in combination with metformin or sulfonylureas for treating type 2 diabetes .
Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) also are commonly used , but the efficacy of exenatide with a TZD has not been reported .
OBJECTIVE : To compare the effects of exenatide versus placebo on glycemic control .
DESIGN : Placebo run - in , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial conducted from May 2004 to August 2005 .
SETTING : 49 sites in Canada , Spain , and the United States .
PATIENTS : 233 ( exenatide group , n = 121 ; placebo group , n = 112 ) patients with type 2 diabetes that was suboptimally controlled with TZD treatment ( with or without metformin ) .
Mean ( + / - SE ) baseline glycated hemoglobin A1c level was 7 . 9 % + / - 0 . 1 % .
INTERVENTIONS : Subcutaneous abdominal injections of 10 microg of exenatide or placebo twice daily , added to a TZD ( with or without metformin ) for 16 weeks .
MEASUREMENTS : The primary outcome was change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c level .
Other outcomes were fasting serum glucose level , body weight , self - monitored blood glucose level , and any adverse events .
RESULTS : Exenatide treatment reduced hemoglobin A ( 1c ) level ( mean difference , - 0 . 98 % [ 95 % CI , - 1 . 21 % to - 0 . 74 % ] ) , serum fasting glucose level ( mean difference , - 1 . 69 mmol / L [ - 30 . 5 mg / dL ] [ CI , - 2 . 22 to - 1 . 17 mmol / L { - 40 . 0 to - 21 . 1 mg / dL } ] ) , and body weight ( mean difference , - 1 . 51 kg [ CI , - 2 . 15 to - 0 . 88 kg ] ) .
Sixteen percent of patients in the exenatide group and 2 % of patients in the placebo group discontinued treatment because of adverse events .
In the exenatide group , 40 % ( n = 48 ) of patients experienced nausea ( mostly mild [ n = 21 ] or moderate [ n = 19 ] ) , 13 % experienced vomiting , and 11 % experienced hypoglycemia .
In the placebo group , 15 % of patients experienced nausea , 1 % experienced vomiting , and 7 % experienced hypoglycemia .
LIMITATIONS : Combinations with TZDs and sulfonylureas were not tested .
Trial duration was relatively short .
Only 71 % and 86 % of patients in the exenatide and placebo groups , respectively , completed the study .
CONCLUSIONS : Exenatide therapy improved glycemic control , reduced body weight , and caused gastrointestinal symptoms more than placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes that was suboptimally controlled with TZD therapy .

juliorosenstock @ dallasdiabetes . com OBJECTIVE : To determine the safety and efficacy of the long - acting analog insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes who were previously treated with insulin alone .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : A total of 518 subjects with type 2 diabetes who were receiving NPH insulin with or without regular insulin for postprandial control were randomized to receive insulin glargine ( HOE 901 ) once daily ( n = 259 ) or NPH insulin once or twice daily in = 259 ) for 28 weeks in an open - label , multicenter trial .
Doses were adjusted to obtain target fasting glucose < 6 . 7 mmol / l .
At study end point , the median total daily insulin dose in both treatment groups was 0 . 75 IU / kg .
RESULTS : The treatment groups showed similar improvements in HbA1c from baseline to end point on intent - to - treat analysis .
The mean change ( means + / - SD ) in HbA1c from baseline to end point was similar in the insulin glargine group ( - 0 . 41 + / - 0 . 1 % ) and the NPH group ( - 0 . 59 + / - 0 . 1 % ) after patients began with an average baseline HbA1c of approximately 8 . 5 % .
The treatments were associated with similar reductions in fasting glucose levels .
Overall , mild symptomatic hypoglycemia was similar in insulin glargine subjects ( 61 . 4 % ) and NPH insulin subjects ( 66 . % ) However , nocturnal hypoglycemia in the insulin glargine group was reduced by 25 % during the treatment period after the dose - titration phase ( 26 . 5 vs . 35 . 5 % , P = 0 . 0136 ) .
Subjects in the insulin glargine group experienced less weight gain than those in the NPH group ( 0 . 4 vs . 1 . 4 kg , P < 0 . 0007 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : In patients with type 2 diabetes , once - daily bedtime insulin glargine is as effective as once - or twice - daily NPH in improving and maintaining glycemic control .
In addition , insulin glargine deonstrates a lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia and less weight gain compared with NPH insulin .

aminorroaya @ med . mui . ac . ir BACKGROUND : Various oral hypoglycemic agents have already been administered to type - 2 diabetic patients to normalize their plasma glucose concentrations but they have not had complete and sustained success .
In recent years , bromocriptine has been tried with controversial results .
In present study , the effect of bromocriptine on glycemic control was evaluated in obese type - 2 diabetic patients .
METHODS : In a double - blind placebo - controlled clinical trial , 40 obese patients with type - 2 diabetes ( aged 32 - 70 years ) were randomly allocated to the two treatment groups .
The first group received bromocriptine ( 2 . 5 mg daily ) for a total of 3 months .
The second group received placebo .
They had been uncontrolled on fixed doses of glibenclamide or its combination with metformin in the 3 months before enrolling in the study .
The fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) level and glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1 ) were measured and body mass index ( BMI ) was calculated before and 1 , 2 and 3 months after treatment .
RESULTS : The FPG level decreased in the bromocriptine - treated group from 10 . 59 + / - 0 . 42 to 9 . 06 + / - 0 . 41 mmol / l ( mean + / - SEM ; p < 0 . 01 ) , whereas in the placebo group it was not changed , 10 . 69 + / - 0 . 52 and 10 . 6 + / - 0 . 57 mmol / l , respectively .
The HbA1 concentration was reduced in the bromocriptine - treated group from 9 . 9 + / - 0 . 3 to 9 . 5 + / - 0 . 2 % ( p = 0 . 06 ) , whereas it increased in the placebo - treated group from 10 . 2 + / - 0 . 3 to 11 . 3 + / - 0 . 6 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
The differences in HbA1 ( 1 . 8 % , p < 0 . 01 ) and FPG ( 1 . 55 mmol / l , p < 0 . 05 ) levels between the bromocriptine and placebo groups at 3 months were significant .
No changes in body weight or BMI occurred during the study in either placebo - or bromocriptine - treated group .
CONCLUSION : The data further support the contention that bromocriptine improves glycemic control in obese type - 2 diabetic patients , although the mechanism of action remains to be determined .

AIMS / HYPOTHESIS : This 52 - week multinational , randomised , open - label , parallel - group , non - inferiority trial compared clinical outcomes following supplementation of oral glucose - lowering drugs with basal insulin analogues detemir and glargine in type 2 diabetic patients .
METHODS : Insulin - naive adults ( n = 582 , HbA ( 1c ) 7 . 5 - 10 . 0 % , BMI < or = 40 . 0 kg / m ( 2 ) ) were randomised 1 : 1 to receive insulin detemir or glargine once daily ( evening ) actively titrated to target fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) < or = 6 . 0 mmol / l .
An additional morning insulin detemir dose was permitted if pre - dinner plasma glucose ( PG ) was > 7 . 0 mmol / l after achieving FPG < 7 . 0 mmol / l .
Due to labelling restrictions , no second glargine dose was allowed .
RESULTS : Baseline HbA ( 1c ) decreased from 8 . 6 to 7 . 2 and 7 . 1 % ( NS ) with detemir and glargine , respectively .
FPG improved from 10 . 8 to 7 . 1 and 7 . 0 mmol / l ( NS ) , respectively .
With detemir , 45 % of participants completed the study on once daily dosing and 55 % on twice daily dosing , with no difference in HbA ( 1c ) .
Overall , 52 % of participants achieved HbA ( 1c ) < or = 7 . 0 % : 33 % ( detemir ) and 35 % ( glargine ) without hypoglycaemia .
Within - participant variability for self - monitored FPG and pre - dinner PG did not differ by insulin treatment , nor did the relative risk of overall or nocturnal hypoglycaemia .
Modest reductions in weight gain were seen with detemir vs glargine in completers ( 3 . 0 vs 3 . 9 kg , p = 0 . 01 ) and in the intention - to - treat population ( 2 . 7 vs 3 . 5 kg , p = 0 . 03 ) , primarily related to completers on once - daily detemir .
Mean daily detemir dose was higher ( 0 . 78 U / kg [ 0 . 52 with once daily dosing , 1 . 00 U / kg with twice daily dosing ] ) than glargine ( 0 . 44 IU / kg ) .
Injection site reactions were more frequent with detemir ( 4 . 5 vs 1 . 4 % ) .
CONCLUSIONS / INTERPRETATION : Supplementation of oral agents with detemir or glargine achieves clinically important improvements in glycaemic control with low risk of hypoglycaemia .
Non - inferiority was demonstrated for detemir using higher insulin doses ( mainly patients on twice daily dosing ) ; weight gain was somewhat reduced with once daily insulin detemir .

AIMS : To compare two progressive approaches [ once - daily insulin glargine plus ≤ 3 mealtime lispro ( G + L ) vs . insulin lispro mix 50 / 50 ( LM50 / 50 ) progression once up to thrice daily ( premix progression , PP ) ] of beginning and advancing insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) and inadequate glycaemic control on oral therapy , with the aim of showing non - inferiority of PP to G + L .
METHODS : Patients were randomized to PP ( n = 242 ) or G + L ( n = 242 ) in a 36 - week , multinational , open - label trial .
Dinnertime insulin LM 50 / 50 could be replaced with insulin lispro mix 75 / 25 if needed for fasting glycaemic control .
RESULTS : Baseline haemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) were 9 . 5 % ( PP ) and 9 . 3 % ( G + L ) ; p = 0 . 095 .
Change in A1C ( baseline to endpoint ) was - 1 . 76 % ( PP ) and - 1 . 93 % ( G + L ) ( p = 0 . 097 ) [ between - group difference of 0 . 17 ( 95 % confidence interval : - 0 . 03 , 0 . 37 ) ] .
Non - inferiority of PP to G + L was not shown based on the prespecified non - inferiority margin of 0 . 3 % .
A1C was lower with G + L at weeks 12 ( 7 . 8 vs . 7 . 9 % ; p = 0 . 042 ) , 24 ( 7 . 4 vs . 7 . 6 % ; p = 0 . 046 ) , but not at week 36 ( 7 . 5 vs . 7 . 6 % ; p = 0 . 405 ) .
There were no significant differences in percentages of patients achieving A1C ≤ 7 % , overall hypoglycaemia incidence and rate or weight change .
Total daily insulin dosages at endpoint were higher with PP vs . G + L ( 0 . 57 vs . 0 . 51 U / kg ; p = 0 . 017 ) , likely due to more injections ( 1 . 98 vs . 1 . 79 ; p = 0 . 011 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Both treatments progressively improved glycaemic control in patients with T2D on oral therapy , although non - inferiority of PP to G + L was not shown .
Higher insulin doses were observed with PP with no between - treatment differences in overall hypoglycaemia or weight gain .

Barnett AH ( 1 ) , Charbonnel B , Li J , Donovan M , Fleming D , Iqbal N . Author information : ( 1 ) Diabetes Centre , Heart of England National Health Service Foundation Trust and University of Birmingham , Birmingham , UK .
BACKGROUND : Achievement of glycemic control is an important objective in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) .
OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitor saxagliptin versus placebo as add - on therapy in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with insulin alone or insulin plus metformin .
METHODS : This was a long - term ( 28 - week ) extension of a short - term ( 24 - week ) , randomized , double - blind , parallel - group trial of saxagliptin 5 mg once daily versus placebo as add - on therapy to open - label insulin or insulin plus metformin therapy totaling 52 weeks of treatment .
In contrast with the goal of maintaining a stable insulin dosage during the short - term phase , during the extension phase the insulin dosage was flexible and adjusted as deemed appropriate by the investigator .
The study was conducted in a clinical practice setting , including family practice and hospital sites .
Patients with T2DM aged 18 - 78 years with glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 7 . 5 - 11 % on a stable insulin regimen ( 30 - 150 U / day with or without metformin ) for ≥ 8 weeks at screening were included in the study .
Patients were stratified by metformin use and randomly assigned 2 : 1 to oral saxagliptin 5 mg ( n = 304 ) or placebo ( n = 151 ) once daily .
All patients who completed the initial 24 weeks of treatment were eligible to participate in the 28 - week extension , regardless of whether they had required rescue treatment .
The main outcome measure was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 52 .
RESULTS : In general , the outcomes achieved at week 24 were sustained to week 52 .
Adjusted mean change from baseline HbA1c at week 52 was greater with saxagliptin ( - 0 . 75 % ) versus placebo ( - 0 . 38 % ) ; the adjusted between - group difference was - 0 . 37 % ( 95 % CI - 0 . 55 to - 0 . 19 ) ; between - group differences were similar in patients treated with metformin ( - 0 . 37 % [ 95 % CI - 0 . 59 to - 0 . 15 ] ) and without metformin ( - 0 . 37 % [ 95 % CI - 0 . 69 to - 0 . 04 ] ) .
At week 52 , a greater proportion of patients receiving saxagliptin achieved HbA1c < 7 % than those receiving placebo ( 21 . 3 vs . 8 . 7 % ; between - group difference 12 . 6 % [ 95 % CI 6 . 1 - 19 . 1 ] ) .
The increase from baseline in mean total daily insulin dose at week 52 was numerically smaller with saxagliptin ( 5 . 67 vs 6 . 67 U with placebo ; difference , - 1 . 01 U [ 95 % CI - 3 . 24 to 1 . 22 ] ) .
During the 52 - week study period , the proportion of patients reporting ≥ 1 adverse event ( AE ) was 66 . 4 % with saxagliptin and 71 . 5 % with placebo , the majority being mild or moderate in intensity .
The most common AEs ( ≥ 5 % with saxagliptin or placebo ) were urinary tract infection , nasopharyngitis , upper respiratory tract infection , headache , influenza , and pain in extremity ; the incidence of each AE was similar between treatment groups .
In the saxagliptin and placebo groups , the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 22 . 7 and 26 . 5 % , respectively ; the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia ( fingerstick glucose ≤ 50 mg / dL [≤ 2 . 77 mmol / L ] with characteristic symptoms ) was 7 . 6 and 6 . 6 % , respectively .
Adjusted mean change from baseline body weight was + 0 . 8 kg with saxagliptin and + 0 . 5 kg with placebo .
CONCLUSION : Saxagliptin 5 mg once daily as add - on to insulin , with or without concomitant metformin , produced a durable improvement in glycemic control and was well tolerated over 52 weeks of treatment .

OBJECTIVES : The DPP - 4 inhibitors are incretin - related drugs that improve hyperglycemia in a glucose - dependent manner and have been reported to exert favorable effects on atherosclerosis .
However , it has not been fully elucidated whether DPP - 4 inhibitors are able to improve endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes .
Therefore , we investigated the efficacy of sitagliptin , a DPP - 4 inhibitor , on endothelial function and glycemic metabolism compared with that of the sulfonylurea glimepiride .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : In this multicenter , prospective , randomized parallel - group comparison study , 103 outpatients with type 2 diabetes ( aged 59 . 9 ± 9 . 9 years with HbA1c levels of 7 . 5 ± 0 . 4 % ) with dietary cure only and / or current metformin treatment were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive sitagliptin or glimepiride therapy once daily for 26 weeks .
Flow - mediated dilation ( FMD ) , a comprehensive panel of hemodynamic parameters ( Task Force ® Monitor ) , and serum metabolic markers were assessed before and after the treatment .
RESULTS : During the study period , no statistically significant change in % FMD was seen in both groups ( sitagliptin , 5 . 6 to 5 . 6 % ; glimepiride , 5 . 6 to 6 . 0 % ) .
Secretory units of islets in transplantation , TNF -α, adiponectin and biological antioxidant potential significantly improved in the sitagliptin group , and superoxide dismutase also tended to improve in the sitagliptin group , while improvements in HbA1c levels were similar between groups .
Cardiac index , blood pressure and most other metabolic parameters were not different .
CONCLUSIONS : Regardless of glycemic improvement , early sitagliptin therapy did not affect endothelial function but may provide favorable effects on beta - cell function and on inflammatory and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes without advanced atherosclerosis .

tania . burgert @ yale . edu OBJECTIVE : Although metformin ( MET ) is an insulin sensitizer currently used as an adjunct to the treatment of some of the complications of childhood obesity besides type 2 diabetes mellitus , few studies have comprehensively examined its metabolic and clinical effects in obese children with normal glucose tolerance ( NGT ) .
METHODS : We therefore conducted a 4 - month double - blind clinical trial in 28 obese [ mean body mass index ( BMI ) : 40 . 3 + / - 5 . 7 kg / m ( 2 ) ] , insulin - resistant [ homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance : 7 . 6 + / - 2 . 8 and whole body insulin sensitivity index ( WBISI ) : 1 . 5 + / - 0 . 7 ] adolescents ( age 15 . 0 + / - 1 . 3 yr ) randomized to MET ( n = 15 , dose 1500 mg daily ) or placebo ( n = 13 ) .
RESULTS : The treatment with MET was well tolerated .
MET treatment was associated with a decreased BMI ( p = 0 . 02 ) as well as with a reduction in subcutaneous fat ( p = 0 . 03 ) , particularly the deep subcutaneous fat ( p = 0 . 04 ) as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging .
Postintervention , the MET group had a 35 % improvement in insulin sensitivity ( WBISI ) compared with the placebo group ( p = 0 . 008 ) .
However , significance was lost with adjustments for differences in baseline insulin sensitivity ( p = 0 . 09 ) .
While there was no change in inflammatory cytokines or lipid parameters , cardiovascular function as assessed by heart rate recovery after exercise improved with MET and worsened in placebo ( p = 0 . 03 ) .
CONCLUSION : Short - term use of MET is well tolerated by obese children with NGT and has a beneficial effect on BMI and autonomic control of the heart as well as a trend toward improved insulin sensitivity .
Thus , long - term treatment with MET may provide a means to ameliorate the cardio - metabolic consequences of adolescent obesity .

riddlem @ ohsu . edu OBJECTIVE : To examine the efficacy and safety of adding the once - daily glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor agonist ( GLP - 1RA ) lixisenatide to established basal insulin therapy alone or together with metformin , in people with type 2 diabetes and elevated glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : We conducted a double - blind , parallel - group , placebo - controlled trial .
Patients ( n = 495 ) with established basal insulin therapy but inadequate glycemic control were randomized to add lixisenatide 20 μ g or placebo for 24 weeks .
Basal insulin dosage was unchanged except to limit hypoglycemia .
HbA1c reduction from baseline was the primary end point .
RESULTS : Mean duration of diabetes was 12 . 5 years , duration of insulin use was 3 . 1 years , insulin dosage was 55 units / day , and baseline HbA1c was 8 . 4 % .
With lixisenatide , the placebo - corrected change of HbA1c from baseline was - 0 . 4 % ( 95 % CI - 0 . 6 to - 0 . 2 ; P = 0 . 0002 ) , and mean HbA1c at end point was 7 . 8 % .
HbA1c < 7 . 0 % ( 53 mmol / mol ) was attained by more lixisenatide ( 28 % ) than placebo ( 12 % ; P < 0 . 0001 ) participants .
Lixisenatide reduced plasma glucose levels after a standardized breakfast ( placebo - corrected reduction , - 3 . 8 mmol / L ; P < 0 . 0001 ) ; seven - point glucose profiles showed a reduction persisting through the day .
Reductions in body weight ( placebo corrected , - 1 . 3 kg ; P < 0 . 0001 ) and insulin dosage ( - 3 . 7 units / day ; P = 0 . 012 ) were greater with lixisenatide .
Main adverse events ( AEs ) with lixisenatide were gastrointestinal .
Symptomatic hypoglycemia was 28 % for lixisenatide and 22 % for placebo ; 4 of 328 subjects ( 1 . 2 % ) had severe hypoglycemia with lixisenatide vs . 0 of 167 with placebo .
CONCLUSIONS : By improving HbA1c and postprandial hyperglycemia without weight gain in type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control despite stable basal insulin , lixisenatide may provide an alternative to rapid - acting insulin or other treatment options .

AIM : To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the potent and selective dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( DPP - 4 ) inhibitor linagliptin administered as add - on therapy to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control .
METHODS : This 24 - week , randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blind , parallel - group study was carried out in 82 centres in 10 countries .
Patients with HbA1c levels of 7 . 0 - 10 . 0 % on metformin and a maximum of one additional antidiabetes medication , which was discontinued at screening , continued on metformin ≥ 1500 mg / day for 6 weeks , including a placebo run - in period of 2 weeks , before being randomized to linagliptin 5 mg once daily ( n = 524 ) or placebo ( n = 177 ) add - on .
The primary outcome was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment , evaluated with an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) .
RESULTS : Mean baseline HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) were 8 . 1 % and 9 . 4 mmol / l , respectively .
Linagliptin showed significant reductions vs . placebo in adjusted mean changes from baseline of HbA1c ( - 0 . 49 vs . 0 . 15 % ) , FPG ( - 0 . 59 vs . 0 . 58 mmol / l ) and 2hPPG ( - 2 . 7 vs . 1 . 0 mmol / l ) ; all p < 0 . 0001 .
Hypoglycaemia was rare , occurring in three patients ( 0 . 6 % ) treated with linagliptin and five patients ( 2 . 8 % ) in the placebo group .
Body weight did not change significantly from baseline in both groups ( - 0 . 5 kg placebo , - 0 . 4 kg linagliptin ) .
CONCLUSIONS : The addition of linagliptin 5 mg once daily in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin resulted in a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in glycaemic control without weight gain or increased risk of hypoglycaemia .

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : After a 6 - week run - in when iGlar was introduced and / or further titrated , and oral antidiabetic drugs other than metformin were stopped , 736 basal insulin - treated patients ( mean diabetes duration 12 years , BMI 31 kg / m2 ) were randomized 1 : 1 to open - label , once - daily iGlarLixi or iGlar , both titrated to fasting plasma glucose < 100 mg / dL ( < 5 . 6 mmol / L ) up to a maximum dose of 60 units / day .
The primary outcome was change in HbA1c levels at 30 weeks .
RESULTS : HbA1c decreased from 8 . 5 % ( 69 mmol / mol ) to 8 . 1 % ( 65 mmol / mol ) during the run - in period .
After randomization , iGlarLixi showed greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline compared with iGlar ( - 1 . 1 % vs . - 0 . 6 % , P < 0 . 0001 ) , reaching a mean final HbA1c of 6 . 9 % ( 52 mmol / mol ) compared with 7 . 5 % ( 58 mmol / mol ) for iGlar .
HbA1c < 7 . 0 % ( 53 mmol / mol ) was achieved in 55 % of iGlarLixi patients compared with 30 % on iGlar .
Mean body weight decreased by 0 . 7 kg with iGlarLixi and increased by 0 . 7 kg with iGlar ( 1 . 4 kg difference , P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia ( ≤ 70 mg / dL ) was comparable between groups .
Mild gastrointestinal adverse effects were very low but more frequent with iGlarLixi .
CONCLUSIONS : Compared with iGlar , a substantially higher proportion of iGlarLixi - treated patients achieved glycemic targets with a beneficial effect on body weight , no additional risk of hypoglycemia , and low levels of gastrointestinal adverse effects in inadequately controlled , basal insulin - treated , long - standing type 2 diabetes .

BACKGROUND : Guidelines suggest setting individualised targets for glycaemic control in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes , despite no evidence .
We aimed to assess the feasibility of setting and achieving individualised targets over 24 weeks along with conventional HbA1c reduction using vildagliptin versus placebo .
METHODS : In this multinational , double - blind , 24 week study , we enrolled drug - naive or inadequately controlled ( glycosylated haemoglobin A1c [ HbA1c ] ≥ 7 · 0 % to ≤ 10 · 0 % ) patients with type 2 diabetes aged 70 years or older from 45 outpatient centres in Europe .
Investigators set individualised treatment targets on the basis of age , baseline HbA1c , comorbidities , and frailty status before a validated automated system randomly assigned patients ( 1 : 1 ) to vildagliptin ( 50 mg once or twice daily as per label ) or placebo .
Coprimary efficacy endpoints were proportion of patients reaching their investigator - defined HbA1c target and HbA1c reduction from baseline to study end .
The study is registered with ClinicalTrials . gov , number NCT01257451 , and European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials database , number 2010 - 022658 - 18 .
FINDINGS : Between Dec 22 , 2010 , and March 14 , 2012 , we randomly assigned 139 patients each to the vildagliptin and placebo groups .
37 ( 27 % ) of 137 patients in the placebo group achieved their individualised targets by education and interactions with the study team alone and 72 ( 52 · 6 % ) of 137 patients achieved their target in the vildagliptin group ( adjusted odds ratio 3 · 16 , 96 · 2 % CI 1 · 81 - 5 · 52 ; p < 0 · 0001 ) .
This finding was accompanied by a clinically relevant 0 · 9 % reduction in HbA1c from a baseline of 7 · 9 % with vildagliptin and a between - group difference of - 0 · 6 % ( 98 · 8 % CI - 0 · 81 to - 0 · 33 ; p < 0 · 0001 ) .
The overall safety and tolerability was similar in the vildagliptin and placebo groups , with low incidence of hypoglycaemia and no emergence of new safety signals .
INTERPRETATION : This study is the first to introduce and show the feasibility of using individualised HbA1c targets as an endpoint in any type 2 diabetes population .
Individualised glycaemic target levels are achievable with vildagliptin without any tolerability issues in the elderly type 2 diabetes population .

BACKGROUND : New therapeutic approaches are needed to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , a progressive disorder that often requires combination therapy .
The present study assessed the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin as add - on therapy to metformin and rosiglitazone in patients with T2D .
METHODS : The present study was a randomized double - blind placebo - controlled parallel - group 54 - week study conducted at 41 sites across North and South America , Europe , and Asia in 278 patients with HbA1c ranging from ≥ 7 . 5 % to ≤ 11 . 0 % despite ongoing combination therapy with metformin ( ≥ 1500 mg / day ) and rosiglitazone ( ≥ 4 mg / day ) .
Patients were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to receive sitagliptin 100 mg or placebo once daily .
The main outcome measure was change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 18 .
RESULTS : Mean baseline HbA1c was 8 . 8 % .
The mean placebo - adjusted change from baseline in HbA1c with sitagliptin treatment was - 0 . 7 % ( P < 0 . 001 ) at Week 18 and - 0 . 8 % ( P < 0 . 001 ) at Week 54 .
There were also significant ( P < 0 . 001 ) reductions in 2 - h post - meal glucose and fasting plasma glucose compared with placebo at Weeks 18 and 54 .
Significantly higher proportions of sitagliptin - than placebo - treated patients had HbA1c < 7 . 0 % at Weeks 18 ( 22 % vs 9 % ; P = 0 . 003 ) and 54 ( 26 % vs 14 % ; P = 0 . 015 ) .
Changes in body weight and the rates of adverse events overall , hypoglycemia , and gastrointestinal adverse events were similar in the sitagliptin and placebo groups during the 54 - week study .
CONCLUSIONS : In patients with T2D , the addition of sitagliptin for 54 weeks to ongoing therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone improved glycemic control and was generally well tolerated compared with placebo .

BACKGROUND : Diabetes mellitus is a progressive disorder that often requires combination therapy .
AIM : This study aimed to compare and study of add - on sitagliptin versus pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin .
METHODS : This 12 - week , randomised , open - label and single centre study compared sitagliptin ( 100 mg daily , n = 80 ) and pioglitazone ( 30 mg daily , n = 80 ) in type 2 diabetic patients whose disease was not adequately controlled with metformin .
RESULTS : The mean change in HbA1c from baseline was - 1 . 001 ± 0 . 83 with sitagliptin and - 0 . 75 ± 1 . 20 with pioglitazone , and there were no significant difference between groups ( P = 0 . 132 ) .
The mean change in fasting blood sugar ( FBS ) was - 18 . 48 ± 33 . 32 mg / dl with sitagliptin and - 20 . 53 ± 53 . 97 mg / dl with pioglitazone , and there were no significant difference between groups ( P = 0 . 773 ) .
Sitagliptin caused 1 . 08 ± 2 . 39 kg decrease in weight , whereas pioglitazone caused 0 . 27 ± 2 . 42 kg increase in weight , with a between - group difference of 0 . 81 kg ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
On the other hand , in sitagliptin group , there was greater improvement in lipid profile than pioglitazone group .
CONCLUSION : Sitagliptin and Pioglitazone demonstrated similar improvements in glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients whose diabetes had been inadequately controlled with metformin .
Nevertheless , sitagliptin was more effective than pioglitazone regarding lipid and body weight change .

BACKGROUND : Insulin replacement in diabetes often requires prandial intervention to reach hemoglobin A ₁ ( c ) ( HbA ₁ ( c ) ) targets .
OBJECTIVE : To test whether twice - daily exenatide injections reduce HbA ₁ ( c ) levels more than placebo in people receiving insulin glargine .
DESIGN : Parallel , randomized , placebo - controlled trial , blocked and stratified by HbA ₁ ( c ) level at site , performed from October 2008 to January 2010 .
Participants , investigators , and personnel conducting the study were masked to treatment assignments .
( ClinicalTrials . gov registration number : NCT00765817 ) SETTING : 59 centers in 5 countries .
PATIENTS : Adults with type 2 diabetes and an HbA ₁ ( c ) level of 7 . 1 % to 10 . 5 % who were receiving insulin glargine alone or in combination with metformin or pioglitazone ( or both agents ) .
INTERVENTION : Assignment by a centralized , computer - generated , random - sequence interactive voice - response system to exenatide , 10 µ g twice daily , or placebo for 30 weeks .
MEASUREMENTS : The primary outcome was change in HbA ₁ ( c ) level .
Secondary outcomes included the percentage of participants with HbA ₁ ( c ) values of 7 . 0 % or less and 6 . 5 % or less , 7 - point self - monitored glucose profiles , body weight , waist circumference , insulin dose , hypoglycemia , and adverse events .
RESULTS : 112 of 138 exenatide recipients and 101 of 123 placebo recipients completed the study .
The HbA ₁ ( c ) level decreased by 1 . 74 % with exenatide and 1 . 04 % with placebo ( between - group difference , - 0 . 69 % [ 95 % CI , - 0 . 93 % to - 0 . 46 % ] ; P < 0 . 001 ) .
Weight decreased by 1 . 8 kg with exenatide and increased by 1 . 0 kg with placebo ( between - group difference , - 2 . 7 kg [ CI , - 3 . 7 to - 1 . 7 ] ) .
Average increases in insulin dosage with exenatide and placebo were 13 U / d and 20 U / d .
The estimated rate of minor hypoglycemia was similar between groups .
Thirteen exenatide recipients and 1 placebo recipient discontinued the study because of adverse events ( P < 0 . 010 ) ; rates of nausea ( 41 % vs . 8 % ) , diarrhea ( 18 % vs . 8 % ) , vomiting ( 18 % vs . 4 % ) , headache ( 14 % vs . 4 % ) , and constipation ( 10 % vs . 2 % ) were higher with exenatide than with placebo .
LIMITATIONS : The study was of short duration .
There were slight imbalances between groups at baseline in terms of sex , use of concomitant glucose - lowering medications , and HbA ₁ ( c ) levels , and more exenatide recipients than placebo recipients withdrew because of adverse events .
CONCLUSION : Adding twice - daily exenatide injections improved glycemic control without increased hypoglycemia or weight gain in participants with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes who were receiving insulin glargine treatment .
Adverse events of exenatide included nausea , diarrhea , vomiting , headache , and constipation .

BACKGROUND : Dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( DPP - 4 ) inhibitors may have protective effects in the early stage of atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes , although similar effects in advanced atherosclerosis were not shown in recent randomized placebo - controlled studies .
Therefore , we investigated the efficacy of DPP - 4 inhibitor on endothelial function and glycemic metabolism compared with high - dose metformin .
METHODS : In this multicenter , open - labeled , prospective , randomized , parallel - group comparison study , patients with type 2 diabetes treated with low - dose metformin ( 500 - 750  mg / day ) were enrolled and randomly assigned to a vildagliptin , a DPP - 4 inhibitor , add - on group ( Vilda ) or a double dose of metformin group ( high Met ) for 12  weeks .
Flow - mediated dilation ( FMD ) and serum metabolic markers were assessed before and after treatment .
In addition , glycemic control and metabolic parameters were also assessed .
RESULTS : Ninety - seven subjects ( aged 58 . 7 ± 11 . 0  years ; body mass index , 25 . 9 ± 4 . 4  kg / m2 ; HbA1c , 7 . 3 ± 0 . 5 % ; FMD , 5 . 8 ± 2 . 6 % ) were enrolled .
Eight subjects dropped out by the end of the study .
There were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics .
After 12  weeks , HbA1c was significantly improved in the Vilda group compared with the high Met group ( - 0 . 80 ± 0 . 38 % vs . - 0 . 40 ± 0 . 47 % , respectively ; p < 0 . 01 ) .
However , there were no significant differences in FMD ( - 0 . 51 [- 1 . 08 - 0 . 06 ] % vs . - 0 . 58 [- 1 . 20 - 0 . 04 ] % ) .
Although the apolipoprotein B / apolipoprotein A1 ratio was significantly reduced in the Vilda group compared with baseline ( 0 . 66 - 0 . 62 ; p < 0 . 01 ) , the change did not differ significantly between the two groups ( - 0 . 04 vs . 0 . 00 ; p = 0 . 27 ) .
Adiponectin levels were significantly increased in the Vilda group compared with the high Met group ( 0 . 75 μ g / mL vs . 0 . 01 μ g / mL ; p < 0 . 01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Regardless of glycemic improvement , combination therapy of vildagliptin and metformin did not affect endothelial function but may exert favorable effects on adipokine levels and lipid profile in patients with type 2 diabetes without advanced atherosclerosis .

anthony . barnett @ heartofengland . nhs . uk OBJECTIVE : To evaluate efficacy and safety of saxagliptin as add - on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) with inadequate glycemic control on insulin alone or combined with metformin .
METHODS : Adults ( n = 455 ) with HbA ( 1c ) 7 . 5 - 11 % on stable insulin therapy ( 30 - 150  U / day ± metformin ) for at least 8 weeks were stratified by metformin use and randomly assigned 2 : 1 to receive saxagliptin 5  mg or placebo once daily for 24 weeks .
Patients were to maintain stable insulin doses but these could be decreased to reduce risk of hypoglycemia .
Patients with hyperglycemia or substantially increased insulin use were rescued with a flexible insulin regimen and remained in the study .
Metformin doses were kept stable .
The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA ( 1c ) from baseline to week 24 ( or rescue ) .
RESULTS : Patients treated with saxagliptin versus placebo had significantly greater reductions in adjusted mean HbA ( 1c ) ( difference : - 0 . 41 % , p < 0 . 0001 ) , postprandial glucose ( PPG ) 180 - minute area under the curve ( - 3829 . 8  mg · min / dL , p = 0 . 0011 ) , and 120 - minute PPG ( - 23 . 0  mg / dL , p = 0 . 0016 ) at 24 weeks .
Treatment with saxagliptin resulted in similar reductions in HBA ( 1c ) relative to placebo , irrespective of metformin treatment .
At 24 weeks , difference in adjusted mean fasting plasma glucose for saxagliptin versus placebo was - 4 . 02  mg / dL ( p = 0 . 3958 ) ; 17 . 3 % and 6 . 7 % of patients in the saxagliptin and placebo groups , respectively , achieved HbA ( 1c ) < 7 % .
Mean change from baseline in body weight at week 24 was 0 . 39  kg for saxagliptin and 0 . 18  kg for placebo .
Hypoglycemia was reported in 18 . 4 % and 19 . 9 % of patients in the saxagliptin and placebo groups , respectively ( confirmed hypoglycemia : 5 . 3 % , 3 . 3 % ) .
Other adverse events reported in at least 5 % of patients were urinary tract infection ( saxagliptin , placebo : 5 . 9 % , 6 . 0 % ) , influenza ( 3 . 0 % , 6 . 6 % ) , and pain in extremity ( 1 . 6 % , 6 . 0 % ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Saxagliptin 5 - mg once - daily add - on therapy improves glycemic control in T2D patients on insulin alone or combined with metformin and is generally well - tolerated .

OBJECTIVE : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin as an add - on to metformin therapy in patients with moderately severe ( hemoglobin A ( 1c ) > or = 8 . 0 % and < or = 11 . 0 % ) type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : This was a multinational , randomized , placebo - controlled , parallel - group , double - blind study conducted in 190 patients with T2DM .
After > or = 6 weeks of stable metformin monotherapy ( > or = 1500 mg / day ) , patients were randomized to either the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or placebo to ongoing metformin for 30 weeks .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary efficacy endpoint was reduction in hemoglobin A ( 1c ) ( HbA ( 1c ) ) measured after 18 weeks of sitagliptin treatment .
Key secondary endpoints included reduction in fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) and 2 - hour ( 2 - h ) postprandial plasma glucose ( PPG ) at 18 weeks , and HbA ( 1c ) at 30 weeks .
The proportion of patients meeting the goal of HbA ( 1c ) < 7 . 0 % was also analyzed .
RESULTS : Sitagliptin significantly reduced HbA ( 1c ) , FPG , and 2 - h PPG , compared with placebo ( all p < 0 . 001 ) .
The net improvement in HbA ( 1c ) was - 1 . 0 % at both 18 and 30 weeks , and a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with sitagliptin achieved HbA ( 1c ) < 7 . 0 % by the end of the study ( 22 . 1 % vs . 3 . 3 % , p < 0 . 001 ) .
Sitagliptin was well - tolerated .
Compared with placebo , sitagliptin had a neutral effect on body weight and did not significantly increase the risk of hypoglycemia or gastrointestinal adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS : Addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily to ongoing metformin therapy was well - tolerated and resulted in significant glycemic improvement in patients with moderately severe T2DM who were treated for 30 weeks .

BACKGROUND : A substantial proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes are elderly ( ≥ 65 years ) but this group has been largely excluded from clinical studies of glucose - lowering drugs .
We aimed to assess the effectiveness of linagliptin , a dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitor , in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes .
METHODS : In this randomised , double - blind , parallel - group , multinational phase 3 study , patients aged 70 years or older with type 2 diabetes , glycated haemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) of 7 · 0 % or more , receiving metformin , sulfonylureas , or basal insulin , or combinations of these drugs , were randomised ( by computer - generated randomisation sequence , concealed with a voice - response system , stratified by HbA1c level [ < 8 · 5 % vs ≥ 8 · 5 % ] and insulin use [ yes vs no ] , block size four ) in a 2 : 1 ratio to once - daily oral treatment with linagliptin 5 mg or matching placebo for 24 weeks .
Investigators and participants were masked to assignment throughout the study .
The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24 .
This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials . gov , number NCT01084005 .
FINDINGS : 241 community - living outpatients were randomised ( 162 linagliptin , 79 placebo ) .
Mean age was 74 · 9 years ( SD 4 · 3 ) .
Mean HbA1c was 7 · 8 % ( SD 0 · 8 ) .
At week 24 , placebo - adjusted mean change in HbA1c with linagliptin was - 0 · 64 % ( 95 % CI - 0 · 81 to - 0 · 48 , p < 0 · 0001 ) .
Overall safety and tolerability were much the same between the linagliptin and placebo groups ; 75 · 9 % of patients in both groups had an adverse event ( linagliptin n = 123 , placebo n = 60 ) .
No deaths occurred .
Serious adverse events occurred in 8 · 6 % ( 14 ) of patients in the linagliptin group and 6 · 3 % ( five ) patients in the placebo group ; none were deemed related to study drug .
Hypoglycaemia was the most common adverse event in both groups , but did not differ between groups ( 24 · 1 % [ 39 ] in the linagliptin group , 16 · 5 % [ 13 ] in the placebo group ; odds ratio 1 · 58 , 95 % CI 0 · 78 - 3 · 78 , p = 0 · 2083 ) .
INTERPRETATION : In elderly patients with type 2 diabetes linagliptin was efficacious in lowering glucose with a safety profile similar to placebo .
These findings could inform treatment decisions for achieving individualised glycaemic goals with minimal risk in this important population of patients .

BACKGROUND : This study assessed the efficacy and safety of the once - daily glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor agonist , lixisenatide , in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on metformin ± sulfonylurea .
METHODS : In this 24 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multinational study , patients were randomized to lixisenatide 20 µ g once daily or placebo .
The primary endpoint was absolute change in glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) from baseline to week 24 .
RESULTS : A total of 391 patients were randomized .
Lixisenatide significantly reduced HbA1c levels compared with placebo ( LS mean difference : - 0 . 36 % , p = 0 . 0004 ) .
A significantly higher proportion of lixisenatide - treated patients achieved HbA1c targets of < 7 % ( p = 0 . 003 ) and ≤ 6 . 5 % ( p = 0 . 001 ) versus placebo .
Lixisenatide was associated with a statistically significant reduction in 2 - h postprandial plasma glucose after a standardized breakfast versus placebo ( LS mean difference : - 4 . 28 mmol / L , p < 0 . 0001 ) and a significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose ( p = 0 . 0109 ) .
There was no difference in weight loss versus placebo , with a modest reduction in body weight reported for both groups ( lixisenatide : - 1 . 50 kg , placebo : - 1 . 24 kg ; p = 0 . 296 ) .
The incidence of treatment - emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) was 64 . 3 % with lixisenatide versus 47 . 4 % with placebo , with serious TEAEs reported in 1 . 5 % versus 2 . 1 % of patients , respectively .
The most common TEAE in the lixisenatide group was nausea ( 16 . 3 % vs 2 . 6 % with placebo ) .
The incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was 5 . 6 % with lixisenatide treatment and 2 . 6 % with placebo ( p = 0 . 1321 ) , with no severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia events reported .
CONCLUSIONS : In Asian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus insufficiently controlled on metformin ± sulfonylurea , lixisenatide significantly improved glycaemic control and was well tolerated during the 24 - week study .

jbuse @ med . unc . edu OBJECTIVE : To compare the ability of two starter insulin regimens to achieve glycemic control in a large , ethnically diverse population with type 2 diabetes .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : During the initiation phase of the DURABLE trial , patients were randomized to a twice - daily lispro mix 75 / 25 ( LM75 / 25 ; 75 % lispro protamine suspension , 25 % lispro ) ( n = 1 , 045 ) or daily glargine ( GL ) ( n = 1 , 046 ) with continuation of prestudy oral antihyperglycemic drugs .
RESULTS : Baseline A1C was similar ( LM75 / 25 : 9 . 1 + / - 1 . 3 % ; GL : 9 . 0 + / - 1 . 2 % ; P = 0 . 414 ) .
At 24 weeks , LM75 / 25 patients had lower A1C than GL patients ( 7 . 2 + / - 1 . 1 vs . 7 . 3 + / - 1 . 1 % , P = 0 . 005 ) , greater A1C reduction ( - 1 . 8 + / - 1 . 3 vs . - 1 . 7 + / - 1 . 3 % , P = 0 . 005 ) , and higher percentage reaching A1C target < 7 . 0 % ( 47 . 5 vs . 40 . 3 % , P < 0 . 001 ) .
LM75 / 25 was associated with higher insulin dose ( 0 . 47 + / - 0 . 23 vs . 0 . 40 + / - 0 . 23 units x kg ( - 1 ) x day ( - 1 ) , P < 0 . 001 ) and more weight gain ( 3 . 6 + / - 4 . 0 vs . 2 . 5 + / - 4 . 0 kg , P < 0 . 0001 ) .
LM75 / 25 patients had a higher overall hypoglycemia rate than GL patients ( 28 . 0 + / - 41 . 6 vs . 23 . 1 + / - 40 . 7 episodes x pt ( - 1 ) x year ( - 1 ) , P = 0 . 007 ) but lower nocturnal hypoglycemia rate ( 8 . 9 + / - 19 . 3 vs . 11 . 4 + / - 25 . 3 episodes x pt ( - 1 ) x year ( - 1 ) , P = 0 . 009 ) .
Severe hypoglycemia rates were low in both groups ( LM75 / 25 : 0 . 10 + / - 1 . 6 vs . GL : 0 . 03 + / - 0 . 3 episodes x pt ( - 1 ) x year ( - 1 ) , P = 0 . 167 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Compared with GL , LM75 / 25 resulted in slightly lower A1C at 24 weeks and a moderately higher percentage reaching A1C target < 7 . 0 % .
Patients receiving LM75 / 25 experienced more weight gain and higher rates of overall hypoglycemia but lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia .
Durability of regimens will be evaluated in the following 2 - year maintenance phase .

DESIGN : Placebo - controlled clinical trial .
MATERIAL AND METHODS : Twenty - three subjects with risk factors for type 2 DM were randomly assigned to receive 850 mg of metformin or a placebo twice a day for 2 months .
Before and after the treatment , the body mass index and waist / hip ratio were calculated , the body composition was measured through bioelectric impedance and the fasting levels of blood glucose , insulin , triglycerides and cholesterol were measured .
The level of insulin resistance was calculated by the homeostatic model and the level of sensitivity by the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index method .
The Wilcoxon rank test was used .
RESULTS : Twenty - one subjects completed the study , 12 of the metformin group and nine of the placebo group .
In the metformin group , there was a decrease in fat weight from 25 . 9 + / - 9 . 4 to 20 . 8 + / - 9 . 2 kg , p < 0 . 01 , an increase in lean weight from 57 . 05 + / - 13 . 6 to 61 . 9 + / - 16 . 5 kg , p < 0 . 01 , an increase in basal metabolism from 1735 + / - 413 to 1878 + / - 505 calories / day , p < 0 . 05 and an increase in body water , p < 0 . 05 .
There was no significant decrease in insulin resistance .
In the placebo group , the blood glucose increased from 84 . 7 + / - 13 to 96 . 7 + / - 16 mg / dl , p < 0 . 05 .
There were no significant modifications in lipids .
CONCLUSIONS : The administration of metformin for 2 months improves the parameters of body composition and insulin dynamics in subjects with risk factors for type 2 DM .

OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sitagliptin when added to the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and inadequate glycemic control on acarbose monotherapy .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : This was a multicenter , randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blind clinical trial .
Patients ( N = 381 ) with T2DM and inadequate glycemic control ( glycated hemoglobin [ HbA1c ] ≥ 7 . 0 % and ≤ 10 . 0 % ) on acarbose monotherapy ( at least 50  mg three times daily ) were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive the addition of sitagliptin 100  mg or matching placebo once daily for 24 weeks .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Changes from baseline in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) at Week 24 .
RESULTS : The mean baseline HbA1c in randomized patients was 8 . 1 % .
At Week 24 , the placebo - controlled , least squares mean changes from baseline ( 95 % confidence interval ) in HbA1c and FPG in the sitagliptin group were - 0 . 62 % and - 0 . 8  mmol / L ( p < . 001 ) , respectively .
At Week 24 , 37 . 8 % of patients in the sitagliptin group were at HbA1c goal of < 7 % compared with 17 . 2 % in the placebo group ( p < . 001 ) .
Sitagliptin was generally well tolerated , and there were no significant between - group differences in prespecified safety parameters ( symptomatic hypoglycemia , diarrhea , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting ) .
A higher incidence of serious adverse events was observed in the sitagliptin group ( 5 . 2 % ) relative to placebo ( 0 . 5 % ) ; all but one , in the sitagliptin group , were not considered related to drug .
CONCLUSIONS : Sitagliptin was generally well tolerated and provided statistically superior and clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control after 24 weeks of treatment compared to placebo when added to treatment of patients with inadequate glycemic control on acarbose monotherapy .

AIMS : To compare the efficacy and safety of once - daily prandial lixisenatide with placebo in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) insufficiently controlled by pioglitazone ± metformin .
METHODS : This randomized , double - blind study included a 24 - week main treatment period and a ≥ 52 - week variable extension period .
Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive lixisenatide 20 µ g once daily or placebo .
The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) at week 24 .
RESULTS : In total , 484 patients were randomized : 323 to lixisenatide ; 161 to placebo .
After 24  weeks , lixisenatide once daily significantly improved HbA1c ( - 0 . 56 % vs . placebo ; p < 0 . 0001 ) and increased the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7 % compared with placebo ( 52 . 3 % vs . 26 . 4 % , respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 ) and significantly improved fasting plasma glucose ( - 0 . 84  mmol / l vs . placebo ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .
There was a small decrease in body weight with lixisenatide once daily and a small increase with placebo , with no statistically significant difference between the two groups .
Overall , lixisenatide once daily was well tolerated , with a similar proportion of treatment - emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) and serious TEAEs between groups ( lixisenatide : 72 . 4 % and 2 . 5 % ; placebo : 72 . 7 % and 1 . 9 % ) .
Symptomatic hypoglycaemia rates were also relatively low in both groups ( lixisenatide 3 . 4 % and placebo 1 . 2 % ) , with no severe episodes .
Lixisenatide continued to be efficacious and well tolerated during the variable extension period .
CONCLUSIONS : Lixisenatide once daily significantly improved glycaemic control with a low risk of hypoglycaemia , and was well tolerated over 24  weeks and during the long - term , double - blind extension period in patients with T2DM insufficiently controlled on pioglitazone ± metformin .

ThomasF @ ikfe . de AIM : Postprandial release of intact proinsulin ( IP ) is an independent marker for beta - cell dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes .
This open - label , parallel - group , two - arm , pilot study compared the beta - cell protective effect of adding insulin glargine ( GLA ) vs . NPH insulin to ongoing metformin .
MATERIAL AND METHODS : Overall , 28 insulin - naive type 2 diabetes subjects ( mean + / - SD age , 61 . 5 + / - 6 . 7 years ; diabetes duration , 9 . 8 + / - 6 . 5 years ; HbA1c , 7 . 1 + / - 0 . 5 % ; BMI , 30 . 7 + / - 4 . 3 kg / m ( 2 ) ) treated with metformin and sulfonylurea were randomized to add once - daily GLA or NPH at bedtime .
At baseline and after 3 months , subjects received a standardized breakfast , lunch and dinner , with pre - and postprandial blood sampling to measure plasma IP , total insulin and blood glucose ( BG ) .
RESULTS : Insulin dose after 3 months was comparable in both groups ( GLA vs . NPH : 23 . 6 + / - 13 . 4 vs . 23 . 3 + / - 12 . 7 ; p = NS ) .
Both treatments significantly reduced fasting BG levels ( GLA : 158 + / - 19 to 121 + / - 23 mg / dl ; NPH : 156 + / - 34 to 119 + / - 29 mg / dl ; both p < 0 . 01 vs . baseline ) .
Fasting and postprandial BG levels did not differ between groups .
IP levels decreased in both groups ( p < 0 . 05 at all timepoints ) .
Although IP release after breakfast did not differ between treatments , GLA induced a greater reduction in IP release after lunch ( p = 0 . 08 ) and dinner ( p = 0 . 04 ) .
Total plasma insulin levels did not differ between groups .
CONCLUSIONS : Adding basal insulin to metformin reduces postprandial beta - cell load .
While GLA and NPH had comparable effects at breakfast , GLA reduces beta - cell stress more effectively at dinner , and with a trend at lunch , most probably because of its longer lasting pharmacodynamic profile .

Philip . Raskin @ UTSouthwestern . edu BACKGROUND : This treat - to - target study compared the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir ( IDet ) and insulin glargine ( IGla ) in a basal - bolus ( insulin aspart ) regimen in type 2 diabetes .
METHODS : 385 patients were randomized 2 : 1 ( IDet : IGla ) .
Non - inferiority of IDet to IGla was determined by HbA ( 1c ) 95 % CI upper limit < 0 . 4 .
RESULTS : IDet and IGla showed similar efficacy in HbA ( 1c ) reduction at 26 weeks , as the non - inferiority criterion was met at 26 weeks ( LS mean [ Det - Gla ] : 0 . 207 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 0149 , 0 . 3995 ) .
It appeared that IGla in some cases did better than IDet in terms of HbA ( 1c ) , but the difference ( 0 . 207 % ) was not clinically meaningful .
Based on the CONSORT guideline , non - inferiority analysis using the LOCF approach was inconclusive regarding possible inferiority of delta 0 . 4 ( LS mean of [ Det - Gla ] : 0 . 307 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 1023 , 0 . 5109 ) .
HbA ( 1c ) decreased significantly from baseline in IDet ( - 1 . 1 % [ 26 weeks ] , - 0 . 9 % [ LOCF ] , p < 0 . 001 ) and in IGla ( - 1 . 3 % [ 26 weeks , LOCF ] , p < 0 . 001 ) .
Final HbA ( 1c ) were 7 . 1 % ( 26 weeks ) and 7 . 3 % ( LOCF ) in IDet , and 6 . 9 % ( 26 weeks ) and 7 . 0 % ( LOCF ) in IGla .
Final FPG were 130 mg / dL ( 26 weeks ) and 135 mg / dL ( LOCF ) in IDet , and 134 mg / dL ( 26 weeks ) and 137 mg / dL ( LOCF ) in IGla .
There was significantly less weight gain in IDet - treated patients ( 1 . 2 + / - 3 . 96 kg versus 2 . 7 + / - 3 . 94 kg , p = 0 . 001 ) .
Hypoglycemia risk was comparable between groups .
The majority of IDet - treated patients ( 87 . 4 % ) remained on a once - daily basal insulin regimen throughout the study .
CONCLUSIONS : IDet and IGla were both effective and safe treatments for glycemic control in a basal - bolus regimen for type 2 diabetes .
Clinically significant reductions in HbA ( 1c ) were achieved in both groups , but with significantly less weight gain in the IDet group at comparable basal insulin dosage .

AIMS : Dapagliflozin , a highly selective inhibitor of sodium - glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) , reduces hyperglycaemia and weight in patients with type  2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) by increasing urinary glucose excretion .
Long - term glycaemic control , body composition and bone safety were evaluated in patients with T2DM after 102 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment .
METHODS : This randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study ( NCT00855166 ) enrolled patients with T2DM [ mean : age 60 . 7 years ; HbA1c 7 . 2 % ; body mass index ( BMI ) 31 . 9 kg / m ( 2 ) ; body weight 91 . 5 kg ] inadequately controlled on metformin .
Patients ( N = 182 ) were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg / day or placebo added to open - label metformin for a 24 - week double - blind treatment period followed by a 78 - week site - and patient - blinded extension period .
At week 102 , changes from baseline in HbA1c , weight , waist circumference , total body fat mass as measured by dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) , serum markers of bone turnover , bone mineral density ( BMD ) as measured by DXA , and adverse events were evaluated .
RESULTS : A total of 140 patients ( 76 . 9 % ) completed the study .
Over 102 weeks , dapagliflozin - treated patients showed reductions in HbA1c by - 0 . 3 % , weight by - 4 . 54 kg , waist circumference by - 5 . 0 cm and fat mass by - 2 . 80 kg without increase in rate of hypoglycaemia .
Compared with placebo , no meaningful changes from baseline in markers of bone turnover or BMD were identified over 102 weeks .
One fracture occurred in each treatment group .
The frequency of urinary tract infection ( UTI ) and genital infection was similar in both treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS : Over 102 weeks , dapagliflozin improved glycaemic control , and reduced weight and fat mass , without affecting markers of bone turnover or BMD in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin .

AIMS : To test the effect of continuing metformin on weight gain and glycaemic control in patients with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes who need to start insulin .
METHODS : Patients with Type 2 diabetes on maximum tolerated oral agents referred for insulin conversion were recruited from hospital diabetes clinics into a double - blind randomized placebo - controlled trial .
The 183 participants received metformin or placebo , titrated up to 2 g a day or maximum tolerated dose , with insulin started according to local practice .
The main outcome measures were weight change over 12 months , HbA1c , insulin dose , frequency of hypoglycaemia , treatment satisfaction , and well - being .
RESULTS : Over 12 months , metformin was associated with less weight gain than placebo [ mean 6 . 1 kg vs . 7 . 6 kg ; adjusted difference 1 . 5 kg ( 95 % confidence interval 0 . 2 - 2 . 9 ) ; P = 0 . 02 ] , a greater reduction in HbA1c [ 1 . 5 % vs . 1 . 3 % ; adjusted difference 0 . 5 % ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 9 ) ; P = 0 . 02 ] and a lower insulin requirement [ 62 units vs . 86 ; adjusted difference 25 units ( 15 - 34 ) ; P < 0 . 001 ] , but also more hypoglycaemia [ relative risk of any episode 1 . 24 ( 1 . 02 - 1 . 1 ) ; P = 0 . 03 ] .
Treatment satisfaction improved more in patients on metformin than on placebo ( P < 0 . 001 ) , as did the positive well - being score ( P = 0 . 02 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Metformin decreases weight gain , lowers insulin requirement , and improves glycaemic control , and should be continued in patients with Type 2 diabetes who transfer to insulin .

PURPOSE : The objective of this clinical trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of omarigliptin monotherapy in young adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) .
Unexpected efficacy results in this trial led to a series of investigations that identified the use of prohibited medication by a substantial number of trial patients .
METHODS : Patients with T2DM who were ≥ 18 to < 45 years of age and either drug - naive or not on an antihyperglycemic agent for ≥ 12 weeks with inadequate glycemic control were randomized in a double - blind manner to receive omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly ( n = 102 ) or placebo once weekly ( n = 101 ) for 24 weeks .
The objectives of the trial were to assess the effect of treatment with omarigliptin on glycemic parameters , including levels of glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , 2 - hour postmeal glucose , and fasting plasma glucose , and to assess the safety and tolerability of omarigliptin .
Additional investigations into trial conduct included the measurement of drug levels for omarigliptin and metformin in blood samples collected for future biomedical research , available for approximately one half of the patients .
FINDINGS : The mean age of trial participants was 39 . 2 years , approximately 60 % were male , mean body mass index was 32 . 5 kg / m2 , and mean duration of diabetes was 3 . 1 years .
The mean baseline HbA1c value was 7 . 9 % in the omarigliptin group and 8 . 1 % in the placebo group .
After 24 weeks , the least squares  mean change ( 95 % CI ) in HbA1c value from baseline was - 0 . 33 % ( - 0 . 60 to - 0 . 06 ) in the omarigliptin group and - 0 . 45 % ( - 0 . 72 to - 0 . 18 ) in the placebo group , with a between - group difference of 0 . 12 % ( - 0 . 26 to 0 . 49 ; P = 0 . 535 ) .
Similarly , no between - group difference was observed for the other glycemic parameters ( 2 - hour postmeal glucose and fasting plasma glucose levels ) .
No issues were identified in drug allocation , dispensing or supply , patient compliance with trial medication , sample handling or analysis , or site trial conduct that explained the observed results .
Measurement of drug levels from future biomedical research samples uncovered the use , with no investigator knowledge , of an antihyperglycemic agent that was prohibited by the protocol ( ie , metformin ) by 42 . 4 % ( 39 of 92 ) of patients .
Metformin was used by more patients in the placebo group ( 57 % [ 25 of 44 ] ) than in the omarigliptin group ( 29 % [ 14 of 48 ] ) .
IMPLICATIONS : The use of prohibited metformin in a trial of a dipeptidyl peptidase - 4  inhibitor , omarigliptin , introduced a confounding factor that invalidated the results of the trial .
This behavior may have been encouraged in the trial by protocol - specified self - monitoring of blood glucose levels .
Use of prohibited medication may be an underappreciated confounder in clinical trial research .

OBJECTIVE : To examine the efficacy and safety of the once - weekly ( q . w . )
dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitor , omarigliptin , in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) and inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy .
METHODS : In a randomized , double - blind trial , patients with T2DM on a stable dose of metformin monotherapy ( ≥ 1500  mg / day ) with glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) of 7 . 0 - 10 . 5 % were randomized to omarigliptin 25  mg q . w .
or matching placebo ( n = 201 in both ) for 24 weeks ( primary timepoint ) followed by an additional 80 - week treatment period .
RESULTS : At week 24 , from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8 . 0 - 8 . 1 % , the least squares ( LS ) mean ( 95 % CI ) change from baseline in HbA1c ( primary end - point ) was - 0 . 54 % ( - 0 . 69 % , - 0 . 40 % ) in the omarigliptin group and 0 . 00 % ( - 0 . 14 % , 0 . 15 % ) in the placebo group , for a between - group difference of - 0 . 55 % ( - 0 . 75 % , - 0 . 34 % ) ; p < . 001 .
Between - group differences ( LS mean 95 % CI ) for the secondary end - points of 2 - h post - meal glucose and fasting plasma glucose ( omarigliptin vs placebo ) were - 0 . 8  mmol / L ( - 1 . 4 , - 0 . 2 ) ( p = . 011 ) and - 0 . 5 mmol / L ( - 0 . 9 , - 0 . 1 ) ( p = . 010 ) , respectively .
At week 24 , the incidences of symptomatic hypoglycemia and subjects with one or more adverse event ( AE ) , serious AEs , and discontinuations due to an AE were similar in the omarigliptin and placebo groups .
Over 104 weeks , omarigliptin treatment provided a clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c .
CONCLUSIONS : In patients with T2DM , adding omarigliptin 25  mg q . w .
to metformin monotherapy improved glycemic control over 104 weeks and was generally welltolerated with a low risk of hypoglycemia .

AIM : To investigate the safety and efficacy of insulin degludec / liraglutide ( IDegLira ) , a novel combination product , as add - on therapy for people with Type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on sulphonylurea therapy .
METHODS : In this 26 - week , double - blind trial , adults with Type 2 diabetes [ HbA1c 53 - 75 mmol / mol ( 7 . 0 - 9 . 0 % ) ] were randomized to IDegLira ( n = 289 ) or placebo ( n = 146 ) as add - on to pre - trial sulphonylurea ± metformin , titrating to a fasting glycaemic target of 4 . 0 - 6 . 0 mmol / l .
Treatment initiation was at 10 dose steps , and maximum dose was 50 dose steps ( 50 units insulin degludec / 1 . 8 mg liraglutide ) .
RESULTS : The mean HbA1c decreased from 63 mmol / mol ( 7 . 9 % ) to 46 mmol / mol ( 6 . 4 % ) with IDegLira and to 57 mmol / mol ( 7 . 4 % ) with placebo [ estimated treatment difference - 11 mmol / mol ( 95 % CI - 13 ; - 10 ) or - 1 . 02 % ( 95 % CI - 1 . 18 ; - 0 . 87 ) ; P < 0 . 001 ] .
The HbA1c target of 53 mmol / mol ( < 7 % ) was achieved by 79 . 2 % of participants in the IDegLira group vs 28 . 8 % in the placebo group [ estimated odds ratio 11 . 95 ( 95 % CI 7 . 22 ; 19 . 77 ) ; P < 0 . 001 ] .
Mean weight change was + 0 . 5 kg with IDegLira vs - 1 . 0 kg with placebo [ estimated treatment difference 1 . 48 kg ( 95 % CI 0 . 90 ; 2 . 06 ) ; P < 0 . 001 ] .
Confirmed hypoglycaemia occurred in 41 . 7 and 17 . 1 % of IDegLira - and placebo - treated participants , respectively , with rates of 3 . 5 vs 1 . 4 events / patient - years of exposure [ estimated rate ratio 3 . 74 ( 95 % CI 2 . 28 ; 6 . 13 ) ; P < 0 . 001 ] .
IDegLira was generally well tolerated .
The rates of serious adverse events were 20 . 3 and 8 . 0 per 100 patient - years of exposure with IDegLira and placebo , respectively , without obvious patterns in the type of events .
CONCLUSIONS : IDegLira can be used in people uncontrolled with sulphonylurea ± metformin to improve efficacy with a safety profile in line with previous DUAL trials .

AIMS : To test whether a bedtime dose of diazoxide can improve daytime beta - cell function without side - effects in Type 2 diabetes .
METHODS : A double - blind randomized study was performed in 27 Type 2 diabetic subjects ( 17 male , 10 female ) who were treated with bedtime insulin and metformin .
Subjects received either bedtime diazoxide , 100 mg , or placebo for 9 weeks .
Duplicate C - peptide glucagon tests were performed before and in the last days of intervention .
RESULTS : No side - effects of diazoxide were detected .
Treatment with diazoxide did not incur any increase in bedtime insulin .
C - peptide responses to glucagon tended to increase : 0 . 15 + / - 0 . 06 nmol / l vs . - 0 . 01 + / - 0 . 04 nmol / l for placebo , P < 0 . 06 for difference .
Corresponding effects on insulin were 66 . 2 + / - 41 . 7 pmol / l for diazoxide vs . - 84 . 2 + / - 51 . 5 for placebo , P < 0 . 03 .
Treatment with diazoxide decreased fasting glucagon levels by 41 % vs . placebo , P < 0 . 03 .
Glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) levels were not affected , whereas levels of blood glucose post breakfast were higher during diazoxide ( 1 . 34 + / - 0 . 43 mmol / l , P < 0 . 01 vs . placebo ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Bedtime treatment with diazoxide in Type 2 diabetic subjects on bedtime insulin and metformin has no significant side - effects , does not increase bedtime insulin supplementation , tends to ameliorate beta - cell function but fails to improve metabolic control .

OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sitagliptin when added to insulin therapy alone or in combination with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes .
METHODS : After a 2 week placebo run - in period , eligible patients inadequately controlled on long - acting , intermediate - acting or premixed insulin ( HbA1c > or = 7 . 5 % and < or = 11 % ) , were randomised 1 : 1 to the addition of once - daily sitagliptin 100 mg or matching placebo over a 24 - week study period .
The study capped the proportion of randomised patients on insulin plus metformin at 75 % .
Further , the study capped the proportion of randomised patients on premixed insulin at 25 % .
The metformin dose and the insulin dose were to remain stable throughout the study .
The primary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline at week 24 .
RESULTS : Mean baseline characteristics were similar between the sitagliptin ( n = 322 ) and placebo ( n = 319 ) groups , including HbA1c ( 8 . 7 vs . 8 . 6 % ) , diabetes duration ( 13 vs . 12 years ) , body mass index ( 31 . 4 vs . 31 . 4 kg / m ( 2 ) ) , and total daily insulin dose ( 51 vs . 52 IU ) , respectively .
At 24 weeks , the addition of sitagliptin significantly ( p < 0 . 001 ) reduced HbA1c by 0 . 6 % compared with placebo ( 0 . 0 % ) .
A greater proportion of patients achieved an HbA1c level < 7 % while randomised to sitagliptin as compared with placebo ( 13 vs . 5 % respectively ; p < 0 . 001 ) .
Similar HbA1c reductions were observed in the patient strata defined by insulin type ( long - acting and intermediate - acting insulins or premixed insulins ) and by baseline metformin treatment .
The addition of sitagliptin significantly ( p < 0 . 001 ) reduced fasting plasma glucose by 15 . 0 mg / dl ( 0 . 8 mmol / l ) and 2 - h postmeal glucose by 36 . 1 mg / dl ( 2 . 0 mmol / l ) relative to placebo .
A higher incidence of adverse experiences was reported with sitagliptin ( 52 % ) compared with placebo ( 43 % ) , due mainly to the increased incidence of hypoglycaemia ( sitagliptin , 16 % vs . placebo , 8 % ) .
The number of hypoglycaemic events meeting the protocol - specified criteria for severity was low with sitagliptin ( n = 2 ) and placebo ( n = 1 ) .
No significant change from baseline in body weight was observed in either group .
CONCLUSION : In this 24 - week study , the addition of sitagliptin to ongoing , stable - dose insulin therapy with or without concomitant metformin improved glycaemic control and was generally well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes .

freddy . g @ uol . com . br BACKGROUND : Type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) patients often fail to achieve adequate glycemic control with oral antidiabetic drugs ( OADs ) .
Insulin has been shown to improve glycemic control in these patients but with increased risk of hypoglycemia .
This study compared the efficacy and safety of insulin glargine and NPH insulin , both in combination with a once - daily fixed dose of glimepiride , in terms of glycemic control and incidence of hypoglycemia .
METHODS : In this open - label , 24 - week randomized trial in ten Latin American countries , T2DM patients poorly controlled on OADs ( HbA1c > or = 7 . 5 and < or = 10 . 5 % ) received glimepiride plus insulin glargine ( n = 231 ) or NPH insulin ( n = 250 ) using a forced titration algorithm .
The primary endpoint was the equivalence of 24 - week mean changes in HbA1c .
RESULTS : Insulin glargine and NPH insulin achieved similar HbA1c reductions ( adjusted mean difference - 0 . 047 ; 90 % CI - 0 . 232 , 0 . 138 ; per - protocol analysis ) .
Confirmed nocturnal hypoglycemia was significantly lower with insulin glargine vs . NPH insulin ( 16 . 9 vs . 30 . 0 % ; p < 0 . 01 ; safety analysis ) .
Patients receiving insulin glargine were significantly more likely to achieve HbA1c levels < 7 . 0 % without hypoglycemia ( 27 vs . 17 % ; p = 0 . 014 ; per - protocol analysis ) .
There was a more pronounced treatment satisfaction improvement with insulin glargine vs . NPH insulin ( p < 0 . 02 ; full analysis ) .
The proportion of patients who lost time from work or normal activities due to diabetes was lower with insulin glargine vs . NPH ( 1 . 8 vs . 3 . 3 % ; full analysis ) .
CONCLUSIONS : In patients with T2DM , inadequately controlled on OADs , once - daily insulin glargine plus glimepiride is effective in improving metabolic control with a reduced incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin .

wolfgang . kothny @ novartis . com AIM : The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin 50 mg bid as add - on therapy to insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) .
METHODS : This is a multicentre , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel group , clinical trial in T2DM patients inadequately controlled by stable insulin therapy , with or without metformin .
Patients received treatment with vildagliptin 50 mg bid or placebo for 24 weeks .
RESULTS : In all , 449 patients were randomized to vildagliptin ( n = 228 ) or placebo ( n = 221 ) .
After 24 weeks , the difference in adjusted mean change in haemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) between vildagliptin and placebo was - 0 . 7 ± 0 . 1 % ( p < 0 . 001 ) in the overall study population , - 0 . 6 ± 0 . 1 % ( p < 0 . 001 ) in the subgroup also receiving metformin and - 0 . 8 ± 0 . 2 % ( p < 0 . 001 ) in the subgroup without metformin .
Vildagliptin therapy was well tolerated and had a similarly low incidence of hypoglycaemia compared with placebo ( 8 . 4 vs . 7 . 2 % , p = 0 . 66 ) in spite of improved glycaemic control , and was not associated with weight gain .
( + 0 . 1 vs . - 0 . 4 kg ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Vildagliptin 50 mg bid added to insulin significantly reduced HbA1c in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled by insulin , with or without metformin .
Vildagliptin was well tolerated , with a safety profile similar to placebo .
These results were achieved without weight gain or an increase in hypoglycaemia incidence or severity in spite of improved glycaemic control .

AIM : To confirm glycaemic control superiority of mealtime fast - acting insulin aspart ( faster aspart ) in a basal - bolus ( BB ) regimen vs basal - only insulin .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : In this open - label , randomized , 18 - week trial ( 51 sites ; 6 countries ) , adults ( n = 236 ) with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes ( T2D ; mean glycosylated haemoglobin [ HbA1c ] ± SD : 7 . 9 % ± 0 . 7 % [ 63 . 1 ± 7 . 5  mmol / mol ] ) receiving basal insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs underwent 8 - week optimization of prior once - daily basal insulin followed by randomization 1 : 1 to either a BB regimen with faster aspart ( n = 116 ) or continuation of once - daily basal insulin ( n = 120 ) , both with metformin .
Primary endpoint was HbA1c change from baseline after 18  weeks of treatment .
Secondary endpoints included : postprandial plasma glucose ( PPG ) change and overall PPG increment ( all meals ) ; weight ; treatment - emergent adverse events ; hypoglycaemic episodes .
RESULTS : HbA1c decreased from 7 . 9 % ( 63 . 2  mmol / mol ) to 6 . 8 % ( 50 . 7  mmol / mol ; BB group ) and from 7 . 9 % ( 63 . 2  mmol / mol ) to 7 . 7 % ( 60 . 7  mmol / mol ; basal - only group ) ; estimated treatment difference [ 95 % confidence interval ] - 0 . 94 % [ - 1 . 17 ; - 0 . 72 ] ; - 10 . 3  mmol / mol [ - 12 . 8 ; - 7 . 8 ] ; P < . 0001 .
Reductions from baseline in overall mean 2 - hour PPG and overall PPG increment for all meals ( self - measured plasma glucose profiles ) were statistically significant in favour of BB treatment ( P < . 0001 ) .
Severe / blood glucose confirmed hypoglycaemia rate ( 12 . 8 vs 2 . 0 episodes per patient - years of exposure ) , total daily insulin ( 1 . 2 vs 0 . 6 U / kg ) and weight gain ( 1 . 8 vs 0 . 2  kg ) were greater with BB than with basal - only treatment .
CONCLUSIONS : In T2D , faster aspart in a BB regimen provided superior glycaemic control as compared with basal - only insulin , but with an increase in the frequency of hypoglycaemia and modest weight gain .

BACKGROUND : In people without diabetes , approximately 50 % of daily insulin secretion is basal and the remainder is postprandial .
Hence , it would be expected that insulin replacement therapy in a 50 / 50 ratio with each meal would mimic physiologic insulin secretion better than treatment with once - daily basal insulin in patients with diabetes mellitus .
Using lispro mix ( LM ) 50 / 50 before meals may be a logical approach to achieving glycemic targets ( glycosylated hemoglobin [ HbA ( lc ) ] and pre - and postprandial blood glucose [ BG ] concentrations ) in these patients .
OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that treatment with a premixed insulin analogue containing 50 / 50 basal + prandial insulins administered before each meal would achieve lower overall and mealtime glycemic control than once - daily basal insulin analogue , both plus metformin ( Met ) , in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
METHODS : This 24 - week , randomized , open - label , parallel - group trial was conducted at 38 sites across Australia , Greece , India , The Netherlands , Poland , Puerto Rico , and the United States .
Male and female patients aged 35 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and an HbA ( 1c ) level of 6 . 5 % to 11 . 0 % , who were receiving metformin and / or a sulfonylurea with a stable dose of 0 to 2 daily insulin injections over the previous 3 months were eligible .
Patients were randomly assigned to receive LM50 / 50 ( 50 % insulin lispro protamine suspension [ ILPS ] and 50 % lispro ) TID plus metformin ( to a maximally tolerated daily dosage of 500 - 1000 mg BID ) ( LM50 / 50 + Met ) or insulin glargine QD at bedtime plus metformin ( 500 - 1000 mg BID ) ( G + Met ) for 24 weeks .
With LM50 / 50 + Met , the insulin dose was titrated to target a fasting BG ( FBG ) level of < 6 . 7 mmol / L ( < 120 mg / dL ) and a 2 - hour post - prandial BG ( PPBG ) level of < 8 . 0 mmol / L ( < 144 mg / dL ) ; those who did not reach the FBG target would be switched from presupper LM50 / 50 to LM75 / 25 ( 75 % ILPS , 25 % lispro ) .
RESULTS : A total of 315 patients were randomized and received treatment ( 158 women , 157 men ; mean age , 57 . 7 years ; mean body mass index , 32 . 1 kg / m2 ; LM50 / 50 + Met , 157 patients ; G + Met , 158 patients ) .
At 24 weeks , the mean ( SD ) HbA ( 1c ) level was significantly lower in the LM50 / 50 + Met group than in the G + Met group ( 7 . 1 % [ 0 . 9 % ] vs 7 . 5 % [ 1 . 0 % ] ; P < 0 . 001 ) , and the proportion who reached an HbA ( 1c ) target of < or = 7 . 0 % was greater ( 88 [ 56 . 1 % ] vs 63 [ 39 . 9 % ] ; P = 0 . 005 ) .
The G + Met group had a lower mean ( SD ) FBG value ( 6 . 5 [ 1 . 6 ] vs 8 . 1 [ 1 . 8 ] mmol / L ; P < 0 . 001 ) .
The LM50 / 50 + Met group had lower mean preprandial BG levels prelunch ( 7 . 4 [ 1 . 9 ] vs 7 . 9 [ 2 . 1 ] mmol / L ; P = 0 . 03 ) and presupper ( 8 . 3 [ 2 . 0 ] vs 8 . 9 [ 2 . 8 ] mmol / L ; P = 0 . 04 ) .
The LM50 / 50 + Met group also had lower mean 2 - hour PPBG values postbreakfast ( 8 . 7 [ 2 . 2 ] vs 9 . 2 [ 2 . 5 ] mmol / L ; P = 0 . 03 ) , postlunch ( 8 . 4 [ 1 . 9 ] vs 9 . 8 [ 2 . 6 ] , mmol / L ; p < 0 . 001 ) , and postsupper ( 8 . 7 [ 2 . 2 ] vs 10 . 7 [ 3 . 2 ] , mmol / L ; P < 0 . 001 ) .
The mean ( SD ) total insulin doses at study end point were 0 . 7 ( 0 . 3 ) U / kg in the LM50 / 50 + Met group and 0 . 6 ( 0 . 3 ) U / kg in the G + Met group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
The mean ( SD ) M - value ( an expression of mean glycemia and the effect of glucose swings ) was statistically similar between the 2 groups at baseline but significantly lower in the LM50 / 50 + Met group at end point ( 17 . 3 [ 13 . 8 ] vs 25 . 1 [ 24 . 8 ] mmol / L ; P < 0 . 001 ) .
During the entire treatment period , mean ( SD ) overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia rates ( episodes per patient for 30 days ) were statistically similar between the 2 groups ( overall , 0 . 8 [ 1 . 4 ] vs 0 . 5 [ 1 . 0 ] ; nocturnal , 0 . 2 [ 0 . 7 ] vs 0 . 3 [ 0 . 6 ] ) .
At end point , the mean ( SD ) nocturnal hypoglycemia rates were similar between the 2 groups ( 0 . 2 [ 0 . 9 ] vs 0 . 2 [ 0 . 6 ] ) , but the overall and non - nocturnal hypoglycemia rates were higher with LM50 / 50 + Met ( overall , 0 . 7 [ 1 . 7 ] vs 0 . 3 [ 0 . 8 ] ; P = 0 . 02 ; non - nocturnal , 0 . 5 [ 1 . 2 ] vs 0 . 1 [ 0 . 4 ] ; P = 0 . 002 ) .
CONCLUSION : In these patients with type 2 diabetes , mealtime LM50 / 50 + Met was associated with lower overall ( HbA ( 1c ) ) and preprandial BG and PPBG levels ( except for FBG ) , with similar nocturnal hypoglycemia and less glycemic variability , compared with G + Met .

riddlem @ ohsu . edu OBJECTIVE : To compare the abilities and associated hypoglycemia risks of insulin glargine and human NPH insulin added to oral therapy of type 2 diabetes to achieve 7 % HbA ( 1c ) .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : In a randomized , open - label , parallel , 24 - week multicenter trial , 756 overweight men and women with inadequate glycemic control ( HbA ( 1c ) > 7 . 5 % ) on one or two oral agents continued prestudy oral agents and received bedtime glargine or NPH once daily , titrated using a simple algorithm seeking a target fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) < or = 100 mg / dl ( 5 . 5 mmol / l ) .
Outcome measures were FPG , HbA ( 1c ) , hypoglycemia , and percentage of patients reaching HbA ( 1c ) < or = 7 % without documented nocturnal hypoglycemia .
RESULTS : Mean FPG at end point was similar with glargine and NPH ( 117 vs . 120 mg / dl [ 6 . 5 vs . 6 . 7 mmol / l ] ) , as was HbA ( 1c ) ( 6 . 96 vs . 6 . 97 % ) .
A majority of patients ( approximately 60 % ) attained HbA ( 1c ) < or = 7 % with each insulin type .
However , nearly 25 % more patients attained this without documented nocturnal hypoglycemia ( < or = 72 mg / dl [ 4 . 0 mmol / l ] ) with glargine ( 33 . 2 vs . 26 . 7 % , P < 0 . 05 ) .
Moreover , rates of other categories of symptomatic hypoglycemia were 21 - 48 % lower with glargine .
CONCLUSIONS : Systematically titrating bedtime basal insulin added to oral therapy can safely achieve 7 % HbA ( 1c ) in a majority of overweight patients with type 2 diabetes with HbA ( 1c ) between 7 . 5 and 10 . 0 % on oral agents alone .
In doing this , glargine causes significantly less nocturnal hypoglycemia than NPH , thus reducing a leading barrier to initiating insulin .
This simple regimen may facilitate earlier and effective insulin use in routine medical practice , improving achievement of recommended standards of diabetes care .

OBJECTIVE : This multicenter , double - blind , treat - to - target , phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of fast - acting insulin aspart ( faster aspart ) versus insulin aspart ( IAsp ) in adults with type 2 diabetes receiving basal insulin and oral antidiabetic agents .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : The primary end point was HbA1c change from baseline after 26 weeks ' treatment .
After an 8 - week run - in to optimize basal insulin , subjects were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to mealtime faster aspart ( n = 345 ) or IAsp ( n = 344 ) , titrated using a simple daily patient - driven algorithm , plus insulin glargine U100 and metformin .
RESULTS : HbA1c change was - 1 . 38 % ( faster aspart ) and - 1 . 36 % ( IAsp ) ; mean HbA1c was 6 . 6 % for both groups .
Faster aspart demonstrated noninferiority versus IAsp in reducing HbA1c ( estimated treatment difference [ ETD ] [ 95 % CI ] - 0 . 02 % [ - 0 . 15 ; 0 . 10 ] ) .
Both treatments improved postprandial plasma glucose ( PPG ) control ; the PPG increment ( liquid meal test ) was statistically significant in favor of faster aspart after 1 h ( ETD [ 95 % CI ] - 0 . 59 mmol / L [ - 1 . 09 ; - 0 . 09 ] ; - 10 . 63 mg / dL [ - 19 . 56 ; - 1 . 69 ] ; P = 0 . 0198 ) , but not after 2 - 4 h . Change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose , body weight , and overall severe / blood glucose - confirmed hypoglycemia rates ( rate ratio [ RR ] [ 95 % CI ] 1 . 09 [ 0 . 88 ; 1 . 36 ] ) were similar between treatments .
Postmeal hypoglycemia ( 0 - 2 h ) rates were 2 . 27 ( faster aspart ) and 1 . 49 ( IAsp ) per patient - year of exposure ( RR [ 95 % CI ] 1 . 60 [ 1 . 13 ; 2 . 27 ] ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Faster aspart and IAsp were confirmed noninferior in a basal - bolus regimen regarding change from baseline in HbA1c .
Faster aspart improved 1 - h PPG with no differences in 2 - 4 - h PPG versus IAsp .
Overall hypoglycemia rates were similar except for an increase in 0 - 2 - h postmeal hypoglycemia with faster aspart .

koivisto_veikko @ lilly . com AIMS : To compare the efficacy and safety of insulin lispro protamine suspension ( ILPS ) versus insulin glargine once daily in a basal - bolus regimen in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) patients .
METHODS : Three hundred eighty - three insulin - treated patients were randomized to either ILPS plus lispro or glargine plus lispro in this open - label 24 - week European study .
Insulin doses were titrated to predefined blood glucose ( BG ) targets .
Non - inferiority of ILPS versus glargine was assessed by comparing the upper limit of the 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) for the change of HbA1c from baseline to week 24 ( adjusted for country and baseline HbA1c ) with the non - inferiority margin of 0 . 4 % .
Secondary endpoints included HbA1c categories , BG profiles , insulin doses , hypoglycaemic episodes , adverse events and vital signs .
RESULTS : Non - inferiority of ILPS versus glargine in the change of HbA1c from baseline was shown : least - square mean between - treatment difference ( 95 % CI ) was 0 . 1 % ( - 0 . 11 ; 0 . 31 ) .
Mean changes at week 24 were - 1 . 05 % ( ILPS ) and - 1 . 20 % ( glargine ) .
HbA1c < 7 . 0 % was achieved by 21 . 7 versus 29 . 4 % of patients .
Mean basal / mealtime insulin doses at week 24 were 29 . 6 / 36 . 2 IU / day ( ILPS ) versus 32 . 8 / 42 . 2 IU / day ( glargine ) ; the difference was not statistically significant for total dose ( p = 0 . 7 ) .
In both groups , 56 . 1 / 25 . 7 % versus 63 . 6 / 19 . 3 % of patients experienced any / nocturnal hypoglycaemia ( p = 0 . 2 for both ) .
No relevant differences were noted in any other variables .
CONCLUSIONS : A basal - bolus regimen with ILPS once daily resulted in non - inferior glycaemic control compared to a similar regimen with glargine , without statistically significant or clinically relevant differences in hypoglycaemia .
ILPS - based regimens can be considered an alternative to basal - bolus regimens with glargine for T2DM patients .

AIM : To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of lixisenatide once daily vs sitagliptin once daily in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes receiving insulin glargine U100 .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : This multicentre , open - label , phase IV study ( NEXTAGE Study ; ClinicalTrials . gov number , NCT02200991 ) randomly assigned 136 patients to either lixisenatide once daily via subcutaneous injection ( 10 µ g initially increased weekly by 5 up to 20 µ g ) or once - daily oral sitagliptin 50  mg .
The primary endpoint was the change in postprandial glucose ( PPG ) exposure 4  hours after a standardized breakfast ( PPG area under the plasma glucose concentration - time curve [ AUC0 : 00 - 4 : 00h ] ) from baseline to day 29 .
RESULTS : Lixisenatide reduced PPG exposure to a statistically significantly greater extent than sitagliptin : least squares ( LS ) mean change from baseline in PPG AUC0 : 00 - 4 : 00h was - 347 . 3 h · mg / dL ( - 19 . 3 h · mmol / L ) in the lixisenatide group and - 113 . 3 h · mg / dL ( - 6 . 3 h · mmol / L ) in the sitagliptin group ( LS mean between - group difference - 234 . 0 h · mg / dL [ - 13 . 0 h · mmol / L ] , 95 % confidence interval - 285 . 02 to - 183 . 00 h · mg / dL [ - 15 . 8 to - 10 . 2 h · mmol / L ] ; P < . 0001 ) .
Lixisenatide led to significantly greater LS mean reductions in maximum PPG excursion than sitagliptin ( - 122 . 4 vs - 46 . 6 mg / dL [ - 6 . 8 vs - 2 . 6 h · mmol / L ] ; P < . 0001 ) .
Change - from - baseline reductions in exposure to C - peptide , fasting glycoalbumin levels , and the gastric emptying rate were greater in the lixisenatide than in the sitagliptin group .
The incidence of treatment - emergent adverse events was higher with lixisenatide ( 60 . 9 % ) than with sitagliptin ( 16 . 4 % ) , with no serious events or severe hypoglycaemia reported .
CONCLUSION : Lixisenatide reduced PPG significantly more than sitagliptin , when these agents were added to basal insulin glargine U100 , and was well tolerated .

AIMS : To test the hypothesis that initiation and intensification with 25 % insulin lispro , 75 % insulin lispro protamine suspension ( LM25 ) , is non - inferior to initiation and intensification with glargine + insulin lispro therapy on change from baseline in HbA ( 1c ) .
METHODS : In this randomized , non - inferiority ( margin of 0 . 4 % ) , parallel , prospective , multi - country , 48 - week , open - label study , patients ( n = 426 ) with Type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with oral anti - hyperglycaemic medications were assigned to either initiating therapy with one daily LM25 injection , progressing up to three daily injections ( full analysis set n = 211 ; per protocol set n = 177 ) or initiating therapy with one daily glargine injection and progressing up to three daily insulin lispro injections ( full analysis set n = 212 ; per protocol set n = 184 ) .
RESULTS : LM25 therapy was found to be non - inferior to glargine + insulin lispro therapy by study end ( upper limit of 95 % CI < 0 . 4 ) , with a least - squares mean difference ( 95 % CI ) in HbA ( 1c ) ( LM25 minus glargine + insulin lispro ) of - 0 . 4 mmol / mol ( 95 % CI - 2 . 7 to 1 . 9 ) ; - 0 . 04 % ( 95 % CI - 0 . 25 to 0 . 17 ) .
No statistically significant differences between treatment groups were found in the percentage of patients achieving HbA ( 1c ) targets or postprandial blood glucose levels .
The increase in insulin dose , number of injections and weight change during the course of the study were similar in both groups .
Patients in both groups experienced similar hypoglycaemia rates and safety profile .
CONCLUSIONS : For patients with Type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with oral anti - hyperglycaemic medications , glycaemic control when initiating and intensifying with LM25 therapy was found to be non - inferior to treatment with glargine + insulin lispro therapy .

AIM : This randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled parallel - group study assessed the effects of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition by dapagliflozin on insulin sensitivity and secretion in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , who had inadequate glycemic control with metformin ( with or without an insulin secretagogue ) .
SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Forty - four subjects were randomized to receive dapagliflozin 5 mg or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks .
Subjects continued stable doses of background antidiabetes medication throughout the study .
Insulin sensitivity was assessed by measuring the glucose disappearance rate ( GDR ) during the last 40 min of a 5 - h hyperinsulinemic , euglycemic clamp .
Insulin secretion was determined as the acute insulin response to glucose ( AIRg ) during the first 10 min of a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test .
Where noted , data were adjusted for baseline values and background antidiabetes medication .
RESULTS : An adjusted mean increase from baseline in GDR ( last observation carried forward ) , at Week 12 , was observed with dapagliflozin ( 7 . 98 % ) versus a decrease with placebo ( - 9 . 99 % ) .
The 19 . 97 % ( 95 % confidence interval 5 . 75 - 36 . 10 ) difference in GDR versus placebo was statistically significant ( P = 0 . 0059 ) .
A change from baseline in adjusted mean AIRg of 15 . 39 mU / L min was observed with dapagliflozin at Week 12 , versus - 12 . 73 mU / L min with placebo ( P = 0 . 0598 ) .
Over 12 weeks , numerical reductions from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , fasting plasma glucose , and body weight were observed with dapagliflozin ( - 0 . 38 % , - 0 . 39 mmol / L , and - 1 . 58 % , respectively ) versus slight numerical increases with placebo ( 0 . 03 % , 0 . 26 mmol / L , and 0 . 62 % , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS : In patients with T2DM and inadequate glycemic control , dapagliflozin treatment improved insulin sensitivity in the setting of reductions in HbA1c and weight .

philippe . moulin @ chu - lyon . fr OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of benfluorex over placebo as an add - on therapy in type 2 diabetic patients in whom diabetes is insufficiently controlled by sulfonylurea monotherapy and who have a limitation for the use of metformin .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Type 2 diabetic patients with HbA ( 1c ) ( A1C ) ( 7 - 10 % ) who were receiving the maximum tolerated sulfonylurea dose and had a contraindication to or poor tolerance of metformin were randomly assigned ( double blind ) to receive benfluorex 450 mg / day ( n = 165 ) or placebo ( n = 160 ) for 18 weeks .
The main efficacy criterion was A1C , analyzed as the change from baseline to the end of treatment using ANCOVA with baseline and country as covariates .
Secondary criteria were fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , insulin resistance , and plasma lipid level .
RESULTS : Both groups were similar at baseline in the intention - to - treat population .
A1C significantly decreased with benfluorex from 8 . 34 + / - 0 . 83 to 7 . 52 + / - 1 . 04 % ( P < 0 . 001 ) and tended to increase with placebo from 8 . 33 + / - 0 . 87 to 8 . 52 + / - 1 . 36 % ( NS ) , resulting in a mean adjusted difference between groups of - 1 . 01 % ( 95 % CI - 1 . 26 to - 0 . 76 ; P < 0 . 001 ) .
The target A1C ( < or = 7 % ) was achieved in 34 % of patients receiving benfluorex versus 12 % of patients receiving placebo .
Significant between - group differences in favor of benfluorex were observed for mean FPG ( - 1 . 65 mmol / l ) ( P < 0 . 001 ) and for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance .
Overall tolerance was similar in both groups .
Serious adverse events were more frequent in the benfluorex group , without evidence of causality relationship .
CONCLUSIONS : Benfluorex as an add - on therapy was superior to placebo in lowering A1C with a between - group difference of 1 % in type 2 diabetic patients whose disease was insufficiently controlled with sulfonylurea alone and in whom metformin was contraindicated or not tolerated .

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : In this 24 - week trial , 973 insulin - naive type 2 diabetic patients on stable oral glucose - lowering drugs with A1C 7 . 0 - 10 . 5 % were randomized to glargine once daily or detemir twice daily .
Insulin doses were systematically titrated .
RESULTS 27 . 5 and 25 . 6 % of patients reached the primary outcome with glargine and detemir , respectively , demonstrating the noninferiority of glargine .
Improvements in A1C were - 1 . 46 + / - 1 . 09 % for glargine and - 1 . 54 + / - 1 . 11 % for detemir ( P = 0 . 149 ) , with similar proportions of patients achieving A1C < 7 % ( P = 0 . 254 ) but more detemir - treated patients reaching A1C < 6 . 5 % ( P = 0 . 017 ) .
Hypoglycemia risk was similar .
Weight gain was higher for glargine ( difference : 0 . 77 kg , P < 0 . 001 ) .
Glargine doses were lower than detemir doses : 43 . 5 + / - 29 . 0 vs . 76 . 5 + / - 50 . 5 units / day ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : In insulin - naive type 2 diabetic patients , glargine reached similar control as detemir , with more weight gain , but required significantly lower doses .

AIMS : To assess the efficacy and safety of gemigliptin , a dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitor , added to metformin and sulphonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : We conducted a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial in 219 Korean patients inadequately controlled with metformin and glimepiride .
Participants were randomized to gemigliptin 50  mg once daily or placebo added to metformin and glimepiride .
The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) level from baseline to week 24 .
RESULTS : The baseline HbA1c was 8 . 2 % in both groups .
The addition of gemigliptin to metformin and glimepiride significantly reduced HbA1c levels at week 24 compared with placebo ( between - group difference in adjusted mean change - 0 . 87 % , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] - 1 . 09 % to - 0 . 64 % ) .
Fasting plasma glucose level was also significantly reduced with gemigliptin ( - 0 . 93  mmol / L , 95 % CI - 1 . 50 to - 0 . 35  mmol / L ) , and a higher proportion of participants achieved an HbA1c level of < 7 % ( 39 . 3 % vs 5 . 5 % ; P < . 001 ) in the gemigliptin group than in the placebo group .
Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were modestly but significantly reduced in the gemigliptin group compared with the placebo group ( - 0 . 21  mmol / L , 95 % CI - 0 . 38 to - 0 . 03  mmol / L for total cholesterol , - 0 . 18  mmol / L , 95 % CI - 0 . 34 to - 0 . 01  mmol / L for LDL cholesterol ) .
The incidence of hypoglycaemia was 9 . 4 % in the gemigliptin group and 2 . 7 % in the placebo group .
CONCLUSIONS : Gemigliptin significantly improved glycaemic control in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin and sulphonylurea .
The incidence of hypoglycaemia was higher with gemigliptin than with placebo , which highlights the importance of optimal dose adjustment for sulphonylurea .

OBJECTIVE : This trial compared the efficacy and safety profiles of the insulin analogues detemir and glargine as the basal insulin component of a basal - bolus regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) who were being treated with oral antidiabetic drugs ( OADs ) or insulin with or without OADs .
METHODS : This was a multinational , 52 - week , openlabel , parallel - group , noninferiority , treat - to - target trial .
Patients with a diagnosis of T2DM for > or = 12 months who had been receiving an OAD or insulin , with or without OADs , for > 4 months were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio to receive detemir or glargine .
According to the approved labeling , detemir could be administered once or twice daily , and glargine was administered once daily .
Insulin aspart was given at mealtimes .
Insulin secretagogues and a - glucosidase inhibitors were discontinued at study entry , and existing OADs were continued .
Doses of detemir and glargine were titrated to achieve a prebreakfast ( and predinner for detemir administered twice daily ) plasma glucose target of < or = 6 . 0 mmol / L .
Patients monitored their plasma glucose levels before breakfast and dinner on the 3 days before each of 13 scheduled visits , recorded their insulin doses on 1 of these 3 days , and recorded their 10 - point self - monitored plasma glucose ( SMPG ) at baseline and after 24 and 52 weeks .
The primary efficacy end point was glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA ( 1c ) ) at 52 weeks ; secondary efficacy end points included changes in fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , postprandial plasma glucose , insulin doses , and weight change at 52 weeks .
Safety end points included the frequency of hypoglycemia and adverse events ( AEs ) .
RESULTS : The intention - to - treat population included 319 patients ( 58 . 0 % male , 42 . 0 % female ; 78 . 4 % white ; mean age , 58 years ; mean weight , 92 . 8 kg ; mean duration of diabetes , 13 . 6 years ) .
At study entry , 46 . 1 % of patients were receiving insulin and > or = 1 OAD , 35 . 4 were receiving insulin only , and 18 . 5 % were receiving > or = 1 OAD only .
At 52 weeks , there was no significant difference between detemir and glargine in terms of mean HbA ( 1c ) ( 7 . 19 % and 7 . 03 % , respectively ; mean difference , 0 . 17 % [ 95 % CI , - 0 . 07 to 0 . 40 ] ) or the mean decrease in HbAlc from baseline ( - 1 . 52 % and - 1 . 68 % ) .
The reduction in HbA ( 1c ) was not significantly affected by whether detemir was administered once or twice daily .
There were no significant differences between groups in terms of mean FPG ( 7 . 05 and 6 . 68 mmol / L ) or the mean change in FPG from baseline ( - 2 . 56 and - 2 . 92 mmol / L ; mean difference , 0 . 36 ; 95 % CI , - 0 . 26 to 0 . 99 ) .
The overall shape of the 10 - point SMPG profiles was not significantly different between groups .
Mean weight gain at 52 weeks was significantly lower with detemir than with glargine ( 2 . 8 vs 3 . 8 kg ; mean difference , - 1 . 04 ; 95 % CI , - 2 . 08 to - 0 . 01 ; P < 0 . 05 ) .
Doses of basal and prandial insulins at the end of the study were not significantly different between groups .
Major hypoglycemic episodes were reported by 4 . 7 % and 5 . 7 % of patients in the respective treatment groups .
There was no significant difference in the risk of hypoglycemia between groups .
The proportion of patients with AEs and the number of AEs per patient were comparable between groups ( 185 / 214 patients [ 86 . 4 % ] reporting 743 AEs and 88 / 105 patients [ 83 . 8 % ] reporting 377 AEs ) .
CONCLUSIONS : when used as indicated as part of a basal - bolus regimen in patients with T2DM who had previously received other insulin and / or OAD regimens , detemir was noninferior to glargine in its effects on overall glycemic control .
Both basal insulins were associated with clinically relevant reductions in hyperglycemia .
Both were well tolerated , with no significant difference in the frequency of hypoglycemia or AEs .

AIMS / HYPOTHESIS : The primary aim of this completed multicentre randomised , parallel , double - blind placebo - controlled study was to elucidate the mechanisms of glucose - lowering with colesevelam and secondarily to investigate its effects on lipid metabolism ( hepatic de novo lipogenesis , cholesterol and bile acid synthesis ) .
METHODS : Participants with type 2 diabetes ( HbA ( 1c ) 6 . 7 - 10 . 0 % [ 50 - 86 mmol / mol ] , fasting glucose < 16 . 7 mmol / l , fasting triacylglycerols < 3 . 9 mmol / l and LDL - cholesterol > 1 . 55 mmol / l ) treated with diet and exercise , sulfonylurea , metformin or a combination thereof , were randomised by a central coordinator to either 3 . 75 g / day colesevelam ( n = 30 ) or placebo ( n = 30 ) for 12 weeks at three clinical sites in the USA .
The primary measure was the change from baseline in glucose kinetics with colesevelam compared to placebo treatment .
Fasting and postprandial glucose , lipid and bile acid pathways were measured at baseline and post - treatment using stable isotope techniques .
Plasma glucose , insulin , total glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( GLP - 1 ) , total glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) , glucagon and fibroblast growth factor - 19 ( FGF - 19 ) concentrations were measured during the fasting state and following a meal tolerance test .
Data was collected by people blinded to treatment .
RESULTS : Compared with placebo , colesevelam improved HbA ( 1c ) ( mean change from baseline of 0 . 3 [ SD 1 . 1 ] % for placebo [ n = 28 ] and - 0 . 3 [ 1 . 1 ] % for colesevelam [ n = 26 ] ) , glucose concentrations , fasting plasma glucose clearance and glycolytic disposal of oral glucose .
Colesevelam did not affect gluconeogenesis or appearance rate ( absorption ) of oral glucose .
Fasting endogenous glucose production and glycogenolysis significantly increased with placebo but were unchanged with colesevelam ( treatment effect did not reach statistical significance ) .
Compared with placebo , colesevelam increased total GLP - 1 and GIP concentrations and improved HOMA - beta cell function while insulin , glucagon and HOMA - insulin resistance were unchanged .
Colesevelam increased cholesterol and bile acid synthesis and decreased FGF - 19 concentrations .
However , no effect was seen on fractional hepatic de novo lipogenesis .
CONCLUSIONS / INTERPRETATION : Colesevelam , a non - absorbed bile acid sequestrant , increased circulating incretins and improved tissue glucose metabolism in both the fasting and postprandial states in a manner different from other approved oral agents .

AIMS : To assess efficacy and safety of lixisenatide once - daily versus placebo in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) patients inadequately controlled on sulfonylurea ( SU ) ± metformin .
METHODS : In this randomized , double - blind , two - arm , parallel - group , multicenter study , patients received lixisenatide 20 μ g once - daily or placebo for 24 weeks in a stepwise dose increase on top of SUs ± metformin .
Primary outcome was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 .
RESULTS : Lixisenatide provided a significant reduction in HbA1c at Week 24 versus placebo ( LS mean : - 0 . 85 % vs . - 0 . 10 % ; p < 0 . 0001 ) and more patients achieved HbA1c < 7 . 0 % ( 36 . 4 % vs . 13 . 5 % ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .
Lixisenatide significantly lowered FPG and body weight versus placebo .
In breakfast meal test patients , lixisenatide reduced 2 - hour PPG versus placebo ( LS mean : - 111 . 48 vs . - 3 . 80 mg / dL [ - 6 . 19 vs . - 0 . 21 mmol / L ] ; p < 0 . 0001 ) and glucose excursion ( - 94 . 11 vs . + 6 . 24 mg / dL [ - 5 . 22 vs . + 0 . 35 mmol / L ] ) , and reduced 2 - hour glucagon , insulin , proinsulin , and C - peptide .
The percentage of AEs was 68 . 3 % for lixisenatide and 61 . 1 % for placebo ; and for SAEs : 3 . 5 % versus 5 . 6 % , respectively .
Lixisenatide did not significantly increase symptomatic hypoglycemia versus placebo ( 15 . 3 % vs . 12 . 3 % , respectively ) ; one severe episode of hypoglycemia was reported with lixisenatide .
CONCLUSIONS : Once - daily lixisenatide significantly improved glycemic control , with a pronounced postprandial effect , without significant increase in symptomatic / severe hypoglycemia risk and with weight loss over 24 weeks .

[ The effect of metformin on fasting and postprandial insulin secretion in obese patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 ] .
[ Article in Serbian ] Vukovi ć M , Lapcevi ć M , Kalezi ć N , Gvozdenovi ć BS .
INTRODUCTION : The main causes of reduced glucose levels during metformin therapy appear to be an increase in insulin action in peripheral tissues and reduced hepatic glucose output due to inhibition gluconeogenesis .
OBJECTIVE : The purpose of the study was to establish the effect of metformin on fasting and postprandial insulin secretion .
METHOD : The study carried out was double blind , controlled , comparative , randomized , multicentric , including two groups of out - patient department ( OPD ) patients .
43 patients were administered metformin ( Tefor ICN Canada ) , and 46 patients were given placebo .
Patients enrolled in the study were newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus ( DM ) type 2 , glycaemia < 12 mmol / l , and had the Body Mass Index ( BMI ) > 30 kg / m2 .
Before treatment , blood biochemistry was done : fasting and postprandial glycaemia , glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) value , fasting and postprandial insulinaemia , blood lipids ( total cholesterol , total triglycerides , HDL cholesterol , and LDL cholesterol ) , and gamma glutaryl transferase ( GGT ) level .
BMI was also established .
After 42 days of treatment , fasting and postprandial insulinaemia were tested again .
Analysis of the effects of therapy , and identification of co - variants for fasting and postprandial insulinaemia , were done by ANOVA two way and ANCOVA method .
RESULTS : It was shown that metformin accompanied by diet , as compared to placebo accompanied by diet , lowered the fasting insulinaemia value during six weeks of therapy in obese patients with DM type 2 ( 24 . 392 mU / l vs . 25 . 667 mU / l ) , interacting both with BMI pre - therapy , and interacting with fasting insulinaemia pre - therapy ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
A significant effect of the interaction of covariants BMI and GGT was defined .
As for the effect of therapy on postprandial insulinaemia , it was found that there was a high statistical significance of the effect of BMI interacting with initial values for postprandial insulinaemia before therapy , and interacting with therapy ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
Adjusted mean values for postprandial insulinaemia after therapy in the placebo group were lower as compared to the metformin group ( 44 . 807 mU / l vs . 47 . 114 mU / l ) .
CONCLUSION : It can be concluded that , as compared to place - bo , metformin is more efficient in reducing insulin resistance in obese patients with DM type 2 .
In addition , as compared to placebo , metformin maintains more efficient productive insulin secretion , indicating that metformin protects the pancreas from beta cell depletion .

AIMS : The addition of basal insulin to existing oral therapy can help patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) achieve glycaemic targets .
This study compares the efficacy and safety of insulin lispro protamine suspension ( ILPS ) and insulin glargine in insulin - naive patients with T2D and inadequate control on oral antihyperglycaemic medication ( OAM ) .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : An open - label , randomized , multicentre , multinational 24 - week study of 471 patients receiving ≥ 2 OAMs for ≥ 3 months with a body mass index between 25 and 45 kg / m ( 2 ) and HbA1c 7 . 5 - 10 . 0 % was conducted .
ILPS was injected once or twice daily vs . glargine injected once daily plus prestudy OAMs .
Primary objective compared the HbA1c change from baseline .
RESULTS : HbA1c change from baseline to endpoint was similar in both groups [ - 1 . 46 % ( ILPS ) and - 1 . 41 % ( glargine ) ] .
Least - squares mean difference ( 95 % CI ) for HbA1c ( - 0 . 05 [ - 0 . 21 , 0 . 11 ] % ) , glycaemic variability ( 0 . 06 [ - 0 . 06 , 0 . 19 ] mmol / l ) and weight change ( - 0 . 01 [ - 0 . 61 , 0 . 59 ] kg ) showed non - inferiority ( margins of 0 . 4 % , 0 . 8 mmol / l and 1 . 5 kg , respectively ) .
Percentages of patients achieving HbA1c < 7 . 0 % were 43 . 8 % ILPS and 41 . 2 % glargine .
Mean daily insulin dose was 0 . 39 vs . 0 . 35 U / kg ( p = 0 . 02 ) and weight gain was 1 . 04 vs . 1 . 07 kg for ILPS vs . glargine ( p = 0 . 98 ) .
Overall hypoglycaemia ( episodes / patient / year ) was similar for ILPS and glargine ( 24 . 2 ± 28 . 8 vs . 23 . 0 ± 30 . 9 ) ; nocturnal ( 6 . 1 ± 10 . 6 vs . 4 . 1 ± 9 . 4 , p < 0 . 001 ) rates were higher for ILPS .
Severe hypoglycaemia was higher for ILPS vs . glargine ( n = 9 vs . n = 2 ; p = 0 . 04 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : At endpoint , ILPS was non - inferior to glargine in HbA1c change from baseline , but associated with increased risk of hypoglycaemia .

AIMS : To evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin as add - on therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin plus a sulphonylurea .
METHODS : In this 24 - week , multicentre , randomized , parallel - group , double - blind study , outpatients aged ≥ 18  years with type 2 diabetes , body mass index ≤ 40  kg / m ( 2 ) and inadequate glycaemic control , received saxagliptin 5  mg or placebo once - daily added to background medication consisting of a stable maximum tolerated dose of metformin plus a sulphonylurea .
The primary end point was change in glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) from baseline to week 24 .
Safety and tolerability assessments included adverse events ( AEs ) , hypoglycaemia and body weight .
RESULTS : A total of 257 patients were randomized , treated and included in the safety analysis ( saxagliptin , n = 129 ; placebo , n = 128 ) ; 255 were included in the efficacy analysis ( saxagliptin , n = 127 ; placebo , n = 128 ) .
HbA1c reduction was greater with saxagliptin versus placebo [ between - group difference in adjusted mean change from baseline , - 0 . 66 % ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , - 0 . 86 to - 0 . 47 ( 7  mmol / mol , - 9 . 4 to - 5 . 1 ) ; p < 0 . 0001 ] .
The proportion of patients with ≥ 1 AE was 62 . 8 % with saxagliptin and 71 . 7 % with placebo .
In the saxagliptin and placebo groups , rates of reported hypoglycaemia were 10 . 1 and 6 . 3 % , respectively , and rates of confirmed hypoglycaemia ( symptoms + glucose < 2 . 8  mmol / l ) were 1 . 6 and 0 % .
Mean change in body weight was 0 . 2  kg for saxagliptin and - 0 . 6  kg for placebo ( p = 0 . 0272 ) .
CONCLUSION : Addition of saxagliptin 5  mg / day in patients inadequately controlled on metformin and sulphonylurea effectively improved glycaemic control and was well tolerated .

AIM : To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin vs placebo as add - on therapy to metformin and sitagliptin in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) .
METHODS : This double - blind , placebo - controlled , multi - centre , phase III study was conducted in Korea in 2015 to 2017 .
Patients were randomized to receive either ipragliflozin 50 mg / day or placebo once daily for 24 weeks in addition to metformin and sitagliptin .
The primary endpoint was the change in glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) from baseline to end of treatment ( EOT ) .
RESULTS : In total , 143 patients were randomized and 139 were included in efficacy analyses ( ipragliflozin : 73 , placebo : 66 ) .
Baseline mean ( SD ) HbA1c levels were 7 . 90 ( 0 . 69 ) % for ipragliflozin add - on and 7 . 92 ( 0 . 79 ) % for placebo .
The corresponding mean ( SD ) changes from baseline to EOT were - 0 . 79 ( 0 . 59 ) % and 0 . 03 ( 0 . 84 ) % , respectively , in favour of ipragliflozin ( adjusted mean difference - 0 . 83 % [ 95 % CI - 1 . 07 to - 0 . 59 ] ; P < . 0001 ) .
More ipragliflozin - treated patients than placebo - treated patients achieved HbA1c target levels of < 7 . 0 % ( 44 . 4 % vs 12 . 1 % ) and < 6 . 5 % ( 12 . 5 % vs 1 . 5 % ) at EOT ( P < . 05 for both ) .
Fasting plasma glucose , fasting serum insulin , body weight and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance decreased significantly at EOT , in favour of ipragliflozin ( adjusted mean difference - 1 . 64 mmol / L , - 1 . 50 μ U / mL , - 1 . 72 kg , and - 0 . 99 , respectively ; P < . 05 for all ) .
Adverse event rates were similar between groups ( ipragliflozin : 51 . 4 % ; placebo : 50 . 0 % ) .
No previously unreported safety concerns were noted .
CONCLUSIONS : Ipragliflozin as add - on to metformin and sitagliptin significantly improved glycaemic variables and demonstrated a good safety profile in Korean patients with inadequately controlled T2DM .

OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding the once - weekly DPP - 4 inhibitor omarigliptin or the sulfonylurea glimepiride to the treatment regimen of patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) and inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy .
METHODS : Patients with T2DM and HbA1c ≥ 6 . 5 % to ≤ 9 . 0 % while on a stable dose of metformin ( ≥ 1500  mg / day ) were randomized to omarigliptin 25  mg once - weekly ( n = 376 ) or glimepiride up to 6  mg once daily ( n = 375 ) for 54 weeks .
The primary hypothesis was that omarigliptin is non - inferior to glimepiride in reducing HbA1c at week 54 .
RESULTS : The mean baseline HbA1c was 7 . 5 % in the omarigliptin group and 7 . 4 % in the glimepiride group .
After 54 weeks , the least squares ( LS ) mean change from baseline in HbA1c was - 0 . 30 % in the omarigliptin group and - 0 . 48 % in the glimepiride group , with a between - group difference ( 95 % CI ) of 0 . 18 % ( 0 . 06 , 0 . 30 ) , which met the pre - specified criterion for declaring non - inferiority .
The incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia was 5 . 3 % in the omarigliptin group and 26 . 7 % in the glimepiride group .
With the exception of hypoglycemia , the incidences of adverse events and discontinuations were similar between treatment groups .
Relative to baseline , omarigliptin was associated with a mean weight loss ( - 0 . 4  kg ) and glimepiride a mean weight gain ( + 1 . 5  kg ) .
CONCLUSIONS : After 54 weeks , as add - on therapy to metformin , once - weekly omarigliptin was generally well tolerated and non - inferior to glimepiride in improving glycemic control , with a lower incidence of hypoglycemia and with weight loss vs weight gain .

Objective The present study aimed to compare the effects of the dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( DPP - 4 ) inhibitors vildagliptin and saxagliptin on 24  hour acute glucose fluctuations in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) inadequately controlled with a combination of metformin and sulfonylurea .
Research design and methods This was a 24 week , prospective , randomized , open - label , active - controlled study .
Patients ( N = 73 ) with T2DM who had inadequate glycemic control ( HbA1c 7 . 0 % - 10 . 0 % ) with a stable dosage of metformin plus gliclazide for more than 3 months were randomized to receive either vildagliptin 50  mg twice daily ( BID , n = 37 ) or saxagliptin 5  mg once daily ( QD , n = 36 ) .
Change in mean amplitude of glycemic excursions ( MAGE ) was assessed at the end of 24 weeks .
Results At baseline , the mean ( ± SD ) age was 62 . 9 ± 6 . 55 years , disease duration was 7 . 0 ± 2 . 33 years , and HbA1c was 8 . 4 ± 0 . 68 % .
After 24 weeks of treatment , the MAGE decreased from 5 . 81 ± 1 . 16  mmol / L to 4 . 06 ± 0 . 86  mmol / L ( p < 0 . 001 ) in the vildagliptin group and from 5 . 66 ± 1 . 14  mmol / L to 4 . 79 ± 1 . 25  mmol / L ( p = 0 . 003 ) in the saxagliptin group .
The mean change in MAGE in the vildagliptin group was significantly greater than that in the saxagliptin group ( 1 . 74 ± 0 . 48  mmol / L vs . 0 . 87 ± 0 . 40  mmol / L , p < 0 . 001 ) .
The mean change in HbA1c , from baseline to the study endpoint , in the vildagliptin and saxagliptin groups , was 1 . 22 ± 0 . 40 % and 1 . 07 ± 0 . 36 % , respectively , with no significant difference between the groups ( p = 0 . 091 ) .
The overall safety and tolerability of vildagliptin and saxagliptin were similar .
The limitations of the study were a small number of patients and open - label administration of the study drug .
Conclusion Vildagliptin produced a significantly greater reduction in acute glucose fluctuations compared with saxagliptin when added to a dual combination of metformin and sulfonylurea in Chinese patients with T2DM .

kannp @ med . uni - marburg . de AIM : To compare the efficacy and safety of two analog insulins as starting regimens in insulin - na ï ve Type 2 diabetes patients .
METHODS : In this randomized , open - label parallel study , twice - daily biphasic insulin aspart 30 ( 30 % soluble and 70 % protaminated insulin aspart ; BIAsp 30 ) plus metformin ( met ) was compared with once - daily insulin glargine ( glarg ) plus glimepiride ( glim ) in 255 insulin - na ï ve patients ( 131 male ; mean + / - SD age , 61 . 2 + / - 9 . 1 years ) .
Mean baseline HbA ( 1c ) ( + / - SD ) was 9 . 2 + / - 1 . 4 % and 8 . 9 + / - 1 . 3 % for BIAsp 30 plus met ( N = 128 ) and glarg plus glim ( N = 127 ) , respectively ( P = 0 . 0747 ) .
Primary endpoint was the difference in absolute change in HbA ( 1c ) between groups after 26 weeks of treatment .
RESULTS : HbA ( 1c ) change was significantly greater in the BIAsp 30 plus met group than the glarg plus glim group ( between - group difference : - 0 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : - 0 . 8 ; - 0 . 2 ) ; P = 0 . 0002 ) .
Mean prandial plasma glucose increment was significantly lower for BIAsp 30 plus met compared with glarg plus glim : 1 . 4 + / - 1 . 4 mmol / l vs . 2 . 2 + / - 1 . 8 mmol / l ; P = 0 . 0002 .
During the maintenance phase ( weeks 6 - 26 ) , one major hypoglycemic episode occurred in each group ; 20 . 3 % and 9 % of patients experienced minor hypoglycemic episodes in the BIAsp 30 plus met and glarg plus glim groups , respectively ( P = 0 . 0124 ) .
At end - of - trial , mean daily insulin doses were 0 . 40 U / kg BIAsp 30 and 0 . 39 U / kg glarg .
Glarg plus glim - treated patients experienced significant weight gain of 1 . 5 kg ( 95 % CI : 0 . 84 ; 2 . 19 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Weight change with BIAsp 30 plus met of + 0 . 7 kg was not statistically significant ( 95 % CI : - 0 . 07 ; 1 . 42 ; P = 0 . 0762 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Starting insulin in Type 2 diabetes patients with twice - daily BIAsp 30 plus met can reduce HbA ( 1c ) and mean prandial plasma glucose increment to a greater extent than once - daily glarg plus glim .

pascale . fouqueray @ poxelpharma . com OBJECTIVE : A 12 - week study assessed the efficacy and safety of a new oral antidiabetic agent , imeglimin , as add - on therapy in type 2 diabetes patients inadequately controlled with metformin alone .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : A total of 156 patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive imeglimin ( 1 , 500 mg twice a day ) or placebo added to a stable dose of metformin ( 1 , 500 - 2 , 000 mg / day ) .
Change in A1C from baseline was the primary efficacy outcome ; secondary outcomes included fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) and proinsulin / insulin ratio .
RESULTS : After 12 weeks , the placebo - subtracted decrease in A1C with metformin - imeglimin was - 0 . 44 % ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
Metformin - imeglimin also significantly improved FPG and the proinsulin / insulin ratio from baseline ( - 0 . 91 mg / dL and - 7 . 5 , respectively ) compared with metformin - placebo ( 0 . 36 mg / dL and 11 . 81 ) .
Metformin - imeglimin therapy was generally well - tolerated with a comparable safety profile to metformin - placebo .
CONCLUSIONS : Addition of imeglimin to metformin improved glycemic control and offers potential as a new treatment for type 2 diabetes .

priscilh @ BaylorHealth . edu OBJECTIVE : Therapies that lower blood glucose and provide weight loss may provide meaningful benefits for obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) .
This study assessed the efficacy of taspoglutide compared with placebo on glycemic control and weight in obese patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy .
DESIGN AND METHODS : In a 24 - week , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter trial , obese adults with T2DM were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to weekly subcutaneous taspoglutide 20 mg ( 10 mg for first 4 weeks ) ( n = 154 ) or placebo ( n = 151 ) for 24 weeks .
Efficacy measures included hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) levels , body weight , percentage of patients achieving HbA1c ≤ 6 . 5 and ≤ 7 . 0 % , and fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) .
Adverse events ( AEs ) were assessed .
RESULTS : Mean baseline HbA1c was 7 . 55 % and mean baseline BMI was 36 . 7 kg / m ( 2 ) .
HbA1c reductions from baseline were significantly greater with taspoglutide than placebo ( least square mean [ LSMean ] , - 0 . 81 % vs . - 0 . 09 % ; P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Weight loss at week 24 was significantly greater with taspoglutide than placebo ( LSMean , - 3 . 16 vs . - 1 . 85 kg ; P < 0 . 01 ) .
In the taspoglutide and placebo groups , target HbA1c levels ( ≤ 6 . 5 % ) were achieved by 49 and 16 % of patients , respectively , while 72 and 36 % achieved HbA1c levels ≤ 7 % .
Decreases in FPG were significantly greater with taspoglutide than placebo ( - 23 . 59 vs . 0 . 09 mg / dl ; P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Nausea and vomiting were the most common AEs associated with taspoglutide , but tended to be transient and generally mild or moderate .
CONCLUSIONS : In obese patients with T2DM , once - weekly taspoglutide provided the combined benefits of glycemic control and weight loss .

BACKGROUND : Despite the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) in Asia , clinical trials for glucose - lowering therapies are often dominated by Caucasian and / or Western populations .
The present Phase III randomized placebo - controlled double - blind , 24 - week study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitor linagliptin added to metformin in Asian T2DM patients .
METHODS : In all , 306 patients ( n = 265 Chinese ; n = 24 Malaysian ; n = 17 Filipino ) , aged 18 - 80 years with HbA1c between ≥ 7 . 0 and ≤ 10 . 0 % and on metformin therapy were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to either linagliptin 5  mg daily or placebo added to metformin .
Antidiabetes drugs other than metformin were washed out prior to randomization .
The primary endpoint was change in mean HbA1c from baseline after 24 weeks .
RESULTS : Baseline characteristics were well - matched between the groups ( overall mean [± SD ] HbA1c 8 . 0 ± 0 . 8 % ) .
Adjusted mean ( ± SE ) HbA1c decreased in the linagliptin and placebo groups by - 0 . 66 ± 0 . 05 and - 0 . 14 ± 0 . 07 % , respectively ( placebo - corrected difference - 0 . 52 ± 0 . 09 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] - 0 . 70 , - 0 . 34 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) .
In patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 8 . 5 % , the placebo - corrected decrease in HbA1c was - 0 . 89 ± 0 . 17 % ( P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Adverse events occurred in similar proportions in the linagliptin and placebo patients ( 27 . 3 % and 28 . 0 % , respectively ) and few were considered drug - related ( 2 . 4 % and 0 . 0 % , respectively ) .
Hypoglycemia occurred in 1 . 0 % of patients in both groups .
Linagliptin therapy was weight neutral .
CONCLUSIONS : Linagliptin 5  mg was efficacious and well tolerated over 24 weeks in Asian patients with T2DM inadequately controlled by metformin .
